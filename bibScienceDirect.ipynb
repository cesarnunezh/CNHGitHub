We tested the effects of social psychology-informed influence strategies for increasing rates of participation in an online mental health screening survey (Experiment 1) and a treatment follow-up survey (Experiment 2). METHODS and RESULTS: In Experiment 1 (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa045,569), embedding one or any combination of three motivational appeals (personal gain, community gain, and inclusivity) in screening survey invitation and reminder emails unexpectedly led to lower rates of survey participation compared to when the appeals were not included (overall participation rate\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa012.02%, ORs\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.75 to 0.97, ps\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.001). In Experiment 2 (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0873), a video of a TikTok influencer encouraging survey participation embedded in treatment follow-up survey invitation and reminder emails did not significantly affect survey completion compared to a humorous gif unrelated to survey participation (overall participation rate\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa047.88%, OR\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01.18, p\\xc2\\xa0= .200). Moderator analyses revealed that the video led to higher rates of participation than the gif among White participants (OR\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01.39, p\\xc2\\xa0= .031) and non-Hispanic participants (OR\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01.35, p\\xc2\\xa0= .029) only, whereas the video led to lower rates of participation than the gif among students who did not disclose their race (OR\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.31, p\\xc2\\xa0= .010).

We examine participation in and anticipation effects of two collective, incentive-based initiatives in Ucayali, Peru. The first initiative is a local REDD+ project, the second is Peru's National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). Both initiatives were evaluated at an early stage of implementation, thus any effects are characterized as anticipation effects. We first examine the determinants of participation in the initiatives and find that household participation is negatively associated with agricultural income and positively associated with market access and previous experiences with external initiatives. Next, we use quasi-experimental methods and self-reflexive evaluations to examine impacts on land use and livelihoods. The results show no evidence of anticipation effects on income or land use. Self-reflexive evaluations indicate, however, that a total of 82% of the NFCP participating households perceive a positive effect on wellbeing, while only 39% of participants in REDD+ perceive a positive effect. The differences in perceptions of the two initiatives is attributed to design and implementation factors, including delayed payments, lack of transparency, and limited local input. The study demonstrates the value of self-reflexive evaluations for identifying intangible effects on wellbeing of conservation initiatives.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Deforestation; Payments for ecosystem services; Rural livelihoods; Impact evaluation; REDD+\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Yan Gao, Lu Chen, Zhihao Jia, Liangyu Zhao, Yuke Yang, Chenchen Liu,\\r\\n', b'Social participation and health in middle-aged and older empty nesters: A study on gender differences,\\r\\n', b'SSM - Population Health,\\r\\n', b'2024,\\r\\n', b'101641,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2352-8273,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2024.101641.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827324000417)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Background\\r\\n', b'The growing population of middle-aged and older empty nesters is characterized by poorer health, and social participation (SP) has been shown to improve this situation.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 is advocating for peaceful, accountable and inclusive institutions as one powerful channel to foster global development. Investing in health and health policies can potentially contribute achieving these objectives. After providing a conceptual framework, this article reviews the existing literature on the evidence of the role of health and health systems in promoting social capital and trust, political engagement and participation, and peace that closely relate to the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16. We provide evidence of a systematically positive impact of better physical and mental health on social capital, and on political participation, both contributing to the sustainability of inclusive democratic institutions. We also document that health and health systems can help supporting peace, both via the reduction of social inequality and grievances, and by reducing the disruptive effects of epidemic shocks. Overall, the study provides evidence that health and health systems can generate co-benefits outside the health domain by promoting social capital, political participation and peace.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Health; Health system; Institutions; Social capital; Political participation; Peace\\r\\n', b'Elke Jahn, Michael Neugart,\\r\\n', b'Do neighbors help finding a job?

Combining rich spatial information with administrative records, we find that a 10 percentage points higher neighborhood employment rate increases the probability of finding a job by 1.9%. Displaced workers not only benefit from neighborhood networks in terms of higher earnings and longer job stability but they are also more likely to find a job at the plant of a neighbor. These results indicate that neighbors refer workers to employers and that social norms are less likely to play a role.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Social networks; Job search; Neighborhood; Employment; Earnings; Plant closures\\r\\n', b'Julio Calder\\xc3\\xb3n,\\r\\n', b'The formalisation of property in Peru 2001\\xe2\\x80\\x932002: the case of Lima,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 28, Issue 2,\\r\\n', b'2004,\\r\\n', b'Pages 289-300,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0197-3975(03)00072-9.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397503000729)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper deals with the policy set by the Peruvian government between November 2000 and December 2002, to legalise urban property and secure tenure in Metropolitan Lima. During this period, significant adjustments were made to the legalisation policy. The most important of these are: (i) establishing a link between the central government and local governments; (ii) unifying real estate registries; (iii) promoting real estate registries; (iv) campaigning to register constructions (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfactory declarations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); and (v) seeking to establish a link between title deeds and credit mechanisms. By means of these changes, the Peruvian State (post-Fujimori) has tried to give a technical function to the Commission on the Formalisation of Informal Property (COFOPRI) to replace the image of a policy that had been used politically for electoral purposes, under the Fujimori regime. Furthermore, the paper contributes recent outcomes on the policy proposals made by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto which predicted that holders of title deeds would be able to obtain loans from private banks. This process, which has still not been consolidated, is described and reviewed below.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Secure tenure; Titles deed; Credit\\r\\n', b'Kanat Abdulla, Balzhan Serikbayeva,\\r\\n', b'Gender gaps in labor market outcomes in a resource-dependent country,\\r\\n', b'Resources Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 90,\\r\\n', b'2024,\\r\\n', b'104685,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0301-4207,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.104685.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420724000527)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In the present paper we examine gender gaps in labor market outcomes in a resource-dependent country, the issue that has received scant attention in the literature. Kazakhstan represents a unique context to investigate the impact of mineral dependence on gender equality. Employing micro-level Labor Force Survey data, the study empirically establishes that gender earnings gaps can be partly explained by industry effects, while regional, human capital, and social characteristics could play a minor role in accounting for earnings differences between male and female workers. Further analysis suggests that women in resource-dependent environments face greater disparities in earnings and occupational status. The Oaxaca-Binder decomposition reveals that a large part of the gender gap is unexplained by the differences in the observed characteristics of men and women which could be associated with unobserved factors not included in the analysis. However, the potential for gender discrimination here seems to be quite significant.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Resource-dependence; Gender equality; Occupational mobility\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Justin Tyndall,\\r\\n', b'The local labour market effects of light rail transit,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Urban Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 124,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'103350,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0094-1190,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2021.103350.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000322)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Many US cities have made large investments in light rail transit in order to improve commuting networks.

I propose a new instrumental variable to overcome endogeneity in transit station location, enabling causal identification of neighbourhood effects. Light rail stations are found to drastically improve employment outcomes in the surrounding neighbourhood. To incorporate endogenous sorting by workers, I estimate a structural neighbourhood choice model. Light rail systems tend to raise rents in accessible locations, displacing lower skilled workers to isolated neighbourhoods, which reduces aggregate metropolitan employment in equilibrium.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Transportation; Transit; Residential choice; Neighbourhood change; Spatial mismatch\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David Mart\\xc3\\xadn-Barroso, Juan A.

To do this, we estimate commuting functions by incorporating four types of determinants: the characteristics of the workers, the jobs (or hiring firms), and the municipalities where the workers reside and work, including the unemployment rates to account for disequilibria in their respective local labour markets. After developing a simple model, we estimate these functions based on labour commuting microdata obtained from the population census of Spain for the years 2001 and 2011, periods with important changes in the labour market situation. We estimate commuting functions by means of ordered probit functions. The results show that the duration of commutes has not changed drastically. Additionally, most of the incorporated determinants maintain their sign and change their intensity only slightly over time. The duration of commutes is greater in the case of men, singles, educated and foreign workers, living in rented housing, using public transport, living or working in large cities, and working in large firms. In the same way, commutes are longer when the worker's municipality of residence has a high unemployment rate, and they turn out to be shorter when the municipality of the workplace has a low unemployment rate. Finally, the changes in the unemployment rate, especially in the municipality of residence, have been compensated by variation in their respective parameters, consequently offsetting their effects on commute times.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Commuting; Labour matching; Labour market situation; Microdata; Spain\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Obinna C.D.

This paper draws on a unique dataset combining individual commuting and wage information for working-class residents of London, circa 1930, to analyze, for the first time, the nature of and returns to commuting shortly after when networks were first built. A sizeable majority of working-class Londoners worked within a short walk of their residence in 1890. By 1930, over 70 percent commuted at least one kilometer. Commuting allowed workers to search for jobs over a wider geographic area and across a larger number of potential employers. This, in turn, potentially increased workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bargaining power and improved employer-employee matching. We show that wage returns to commuting were on the order of 1.5\\xe2\\x80\\x933.5 percent per kilometer travelled. Access to public transport increased both the probability of commuting and distance commuted but had little or no direct effect on the probability of being employed or on earnings. We argue that these results are consistent with a search and matching framework; commuting led to workers finding jobs more suited to their skills and to better matches with employers. We also provide descriptive evidence from contemporary sources to describe the impact of commuting on improving quality of life by reducing urban crowding.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Commuting; Labor markets; Earnings; London, GIS, 1930\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Diego Hernandez, Martin Hansz, Renzo Massobrio,\\r\\n', b'Job accessibility through public transport and unemployment in Latin America: The case of Montevideo (Uruguay),\\r\\n', b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 85,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'102742,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102742.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692319308695)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Accessibility to job opportunities is one of the factors that explains labor outcomes. For developing countries, public transport plays a key role in providing the population with access to employment opportunities. This paper aims to quantify accessibility by public transport to employment in Montevideo, Uruguay and to explore how accessibility to job opportunities via public transport relates to unemployment. To do so, we calculate a cumulative measure of accessibility to job opportunities for 1063 small zones\\xe2\\x80\\x94approximately 4\\xe2\\x80\\x936 blocks each\\xe2\\x80\\x94within Montevideo. This measure yields accurate data on accessibility and can be assigned to individual households. Accessibility in Montevideo is unevenly distributed among social strata and is concentrated within the central (and wealthier) areas of the city. In addition, a multilevel logistic regression analysis indicates that greater accessibility to jobs via public transport is associated with a lower probability of being unemployed. This finding suggests that improving accessibility to job opportunities via public transit may enhance individual labor outcomes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Latin America; Montevideo; Public transport; Accessibility; Urban employment\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shamim Noor, Pawinee Iamtrakul,\\r\\n', b\"Women's access to urban public transport: Toward addressing policy constraints in combating sexual harassment,\\r\\n\", b'Transport Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 137,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'Pages 14-22,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0967-070X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.04.010.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X23000975)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Women's physical harassment in public transport (PT) and public spaces is a pervasive and pressing issue across the globe. In developing countries, women's easy access to public transport and harassment-free travel in urban areas have been hindered by a combination of factors. These include gender stereotype behavior, sociocultural stigma, poor transport settings, and a male-dominated transport sector. As a result, women often face numerous acrimonious experiences in their everyday mobility. In light of these issues, this study seeks to analyze existing literature to gain a deeper understanding of how gender roles and women's positions in society shape travel behavior, as well as explore how gender-responsive policy interventions can effectively ensure an inclusive urban transport system for female commuters in developing countries. Through qualitative narrative analysis of previous research, the study aims to frame a conceptual relationship framework, which focuses on identifying micro to macro-level constraints and emphasizes the importance of gender-responsive policy interventions. The study expects that this framework will provide insight into how gender-responsive transport policies and women's participation in the transport sector can address constraints in transit environments. Furthermore, this study will assist in initiating measures to correct the gender-blind approach and provide a solid basis for policy advice in the arena of public transport and gender.\\r\\n\", b\"Keywords: Developing countries; Gender-responsive transport policy; Public transport; Sexual harassment; Socio-cultural perceptions; Women's mobility\\r\\n\", b'\\n', b'Daniel Johnson, Marco Ercolani, Peter Mackie,\\r\\n', b'Econometric analysis of the link between public transport accessibility and employment,\\r\\n', b'Transport Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 60,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1-9,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0967-070X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.08.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X16303353)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Modern transport policy analysis has ceased to be mainly about transport impacts and is now focussed on the effects of provision and policy upon the operation of the economy and society. For people on the edge of the labour market, many of whom do not have access to other forms of transport, public transport is a very important source of accessibility to jobs. This analysis addresses what we see as a key research gap in Britain - whether there is a systematic variation in the level of employment at the local level with the quality of the public transport network. To address this we apply regression analysis to explain employment as a function of accessibility and other local labour and socioeconomic variables. Our data were based on a cross-section of output areas from the English part of the 2011 Census. We found a statistically significant relationship suggesting that, all else being equal, areas with shorter public transport times were associated with higher employment levels.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'\\xc3\\x80ngel Cebollada,\\r\\n', b'Mobility and labour market exclusion in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 17, Issue 3,\\r\\n', b'2009,\\r\\n', b'Pages 226-233,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.07.009.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692308000690)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article analyses the relationship between daily mobility and labour market exclusion.

By linking together and increasing the size of labour markets, the matching between individuals and jobs is improved, and the productivity increases. Communities and municipalities lobby for investments that lead to higher accessibility and those that are successful often see inflows of people as a consequence. This paper looks at the entire Swedish railway network, at the level of service of each station and at the connectivity among stations during the morning peak hour, considering different time bands. Associations between job accessibility levels and socio-demographic features are explored and disclosed, looking at the longitudinal impacts of railway investments over 4 years (from 2011 to 2014) on annual wages. Estimating a fixed effects model, very small effects on wages have been found with the increase in the number of jobs around accessible rail stations. These preliminary results indicate that additional jobs along the rail network seem to have a marginal effect. The findings of this analysis, if communicated to planners, may assist them in assessing the effects of future railway measures to implement over the Swedish territory.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Railway improvements; Job accessibility; Labour markets; Connectivity; Railway impacts; Wages\\r\\n', b\"Marisol Silva-Laya, Natalia D'Angelo, Elda Garc\\xc3\\xada, Laura Z\\xc3\\xba\\xc3\\xb1iga, Teresa Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez,\\r\\n\", b'Urban poverty and education.

The review covers the period 1995\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 and includes 66 articles. The analysis addresses: a) the educational achievement of the urban poor and b) the conditions under which they receive education. Results show that, despite attending school, the urban poor are not able to fully satisfy their right to education. Their educational achievement is deficient in terms of learning, educational trajectory and the capacity to aspire to a better future and although they are included in schooling, material deprivation combined with socio-territorial characteristics and cultural and administrative obstacles means that this inclusion occurs in a stratified manner. The findings urge a reexamination of the discussion around the challenge of education in facilitating social mobility. Breaking the cycle between urban poverty and education requires multisectoral public policies with an equity perspective and the coordinated participation of various social actors.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Academic achievement; Equity and access; Aspirations; School segregation\\r\\n', b'Alfredo Palacios, Julia Gabosi, Caitlin R.

These neighborhoods are characterized by economic vulnerability, social marginalization, and inaccessibility of basic services. The aim of this study is to provide evidence about the environmental risk factors faced by these populations in Argentina, and to identify whether their greater exposure to risk factors is associated with greater accessibility of healthcare services. We analyzed an original database that provides information about basic characteristics of the neighborhood, environmental risk factors (proximity to garbage dumps, industrial waste, and high-voltage towers), and accessibility of basic healthcare services on over 2000 informal settlements in Argentina. We calculated descriptive statistics and developed multivariate econometric models to estimate the probability of accessibility of healthcare services. On average, 31% of informal settlements were close to a garbage dump, 19% were close to a high-voltage tower, and 10% were close to industrial waste. In addition, 39% of these neighborhoods do not have a healthcare center nearby, 65% do not have an accessible hospital, and 39% are not consistently served by ambulances in the event of an emergency. The econometric estimates suggest that the accessibility of hospital healthcare service and to an ambulance service is positively associated with the age of the neighborhood, and whether the neighborhood is a slum, but there is no evidence of association with the exposure to environmental risk factors. In short, the populations living in informal settlements in Argentina are exposed to harmful environmental risk factors. Access to basic healthcare services is limited and does not reflect the elevated exposure to environmental risks. Health, environmental, and economic dimensions should be considered when designing and implementing public policies for vulnerable populations.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Informal settlements; Slums; Environmental health; Urban health; Health services; Poverty; Argentina\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ali Hosseini, Brandon Marc Finn, Ali Momeni,\\r\\n', b\"The complexities of urban informality: A multi-dimensional analysis of residents' perceptions of life, inequality, and access in an Iranian informal settlement,\\r\\n\", b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 132,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'104099,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.104099.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275122005388)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Informal settlements constitute a prominent form of urbanization across the world. The rapid growth of Yazd presents an example of informal urbanization in Iran at the nexus of development, poverty, and inequality. While scholarship on urban informality is abundant, a lacuna exists in the literature on systematic quantitative research on informality among urban residents. The present study investigates residents' perceptions regarding informality and captures their responses before and after the expansion of an informal settlement in Yazd. Through this quantitative research, we aim to articulate and highlight specific domains of informality, offering a framework assessing the complexities of informality that extend beyond only Iranian informal settlements. This paper analyzes the status of urban informality and migration in terms of their social, economic, physical, environmental, and urban management characteristics in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAirport Neighborhood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, a prominent Yazd neighborhood. This paper seeks to add theoretical and empirical depth to the categorization of distinct yet overlapping domains of informality. Our quantitative approach to migration and informality informs our central research question: How does the complexity of informality affect different groups of people living in one informal settlement? We find that recent migrants to the settlement are less involved in urban governance, women experience improved work opportunities after moving to the informal settlement but remain marginalized, and insufficient and poorly maintained infrastructure operates as a significant barrier to socio-economic stability and mobility. We also find that urban settlement results in increased debt among residents in Airport Neighborhood, and that youth unemployment is a significant issue that did not improve for recent migrants to the neighborhood despite young people citing employment as a key motivating factor for migration. Our empirical work highlights the theoretical complexity of informality, as subgroups of people face varying challenges that correlate with their age, gender, and time spent in a particular informal settlement.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Informal settlement; Informality; Urbanization; Developing countries; Yazd; Migration; Development; Inequality\\r\\n', b'Ellis Adjei Adams,\\r\\n', b\"Intra-urban inequalities in water access among households in Malawi's informal settlements: Toward pro-poor urban water policies in Africa,\\r\\n\", b'Environmental Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 26,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 34-42,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2211-4645,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2018.03.004.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464517302178)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Poor access to potable water remains one of the most troubling challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s informal settlements (or slums) where majority of the poor and vulnerable urban population lives. While prior research shows significant disparities in water access between urban and rural areas, little is known about intra-urban inequalities and whether they are influenced by household socio-economic status. This paper draws from household surveys in three urban informal settlements in Lilongwe, Malawi, to explore intra-urban differences in water access based on water source, volume of water per capita, total time/day spent fetching water, and affordability of primary water source. It first compares the proportion of respondents that have access to water based on Malawi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (national) and the United Nations and World Health Organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (international) minimum standards. It then uses linear and logistic regressions to examine socio-economic inequalities in water access. The results show inconsistencies in the proportion of households that satisfy Malawi versus the United Nations and World Health Organization minimum water-access standards. Household socio-economic status (SES) significantly influenced water access, underscoring the need for pro-poor water policies that recognize that even among households in predominantly poor and under-resourced urban settings, significant socio-economic differences underlie inequalities in water access.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Intra-urban inequalities; Water access; Lilongwe; Malawi; Urban informal settlements; Pro-poor urban water policies\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'James Kwame Mensah,\\r\\n', b'Electricity and informal settlements: Towards achieving SDG 7 in developing countries,\\r\\n', b'Energy Research & Social Science,\\r\\n', b'Volume 93,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'102844,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2214-6296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102844.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629622003474)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite many academic discussions on the importance of sustainable and reliable energy to informal settlement dwellers, there is limited evidence on the delivery of electricity in informal settlements, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The paper analyses evidence collected through three focus group discussions of thirty informal settlement dwellers in three communities in Accra. The findings showed that whereas access to electricity in informal settlements has improved significantly, this increase is a result of corruption and connivance with electricity officials and that informal settlement dwellers pay exorbitantly to access and use electricity.

Despite this persistent challenge and its impact on health and well-being, there are scarce comprehensive, standardized, and validated instruments for measuring housing insecurity in these regions. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a housing insecurity scale for slums and informal settlements in the global South. Using a complementary set of qualitative and quantitative techniques, we developed the scale from data collected from three slums in Ghana (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01036) on housing deprivations and characteristics, slum severity, resource insecurity, health outcomes, and socio-demography. Following item generation, domain identification, and content validation, we identified a set of 28 items, which were tested for tetrachoric and Biserial correlations. We then extracted an optimal number of factors and tested for dimensionality using confirmatory factor analysis and second-order confirmatory factor analysis. This was followed by tests of reliability, external validity, unidimensionality of sub-scales, local independence, invariant item ordering, and monotonicity. The resultant scale is a multilevel, multidimensional scale comprising 17 items that subdivide into three sub-scales: lack of essential utility (\\xce\\xb1\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.63), built environment deficiency (\\xce\\xb1\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.80), and tenancy challenges (\\xce\\xb1\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.82). The composite scale is reliable, with a coefficient alpha of 0.83. Criterion concurrent and predictive validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and known group comparisons supported the validity of the scale. Assumptions of sub-scale unidimensionality, local independence, invariant item ordering, and monotonicity were verified. This is one of the few comprehensively validated scales developed to measure housing insecurity in slums and informal settlements in the global South. It can be used to test different hypotheses on the impact of housing insecurity on several environmental and health outcomes; assess and plan clinical, programmatic and policy interventions; and aid in tracking progress made on the Sustainable Development Goal 11.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: global South; Housing insecurity; Scale development; Slums; Informal settlements; Validation\\r\\n', b'Martina Olcese, Paola Cardinali, Francesco Madera, Andrew P.

We tested the effects of social psychology-informed influence strategies for increasing rates of participation in an online mental health screening survey (Experiment 1) and a treatment follow-up survey (Experiment 2). METHODS and RESULTS: In Experiment 1 (N\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa045,569), embedding one or any combination of three motivational appeals (personal gain, community gain, and inclusivity) in screening survey invitation and reminder emails unexpectedly led to lower rates of survey participation compared to when the appeals were not included (overall participation rate\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa012.02%, ORs\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.75 to 0.97, ps\\\\xc2\\\\xa0<\\\\xc2\\\\xa0.001). In Experiment 2 (N\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa0873), a video of a TikTok influencer encouraging survey participation embedded in treatment follow-up survey invitation and reminder emails did not significantly affect survey completion compared to a humorous gif unrelated to survey participation (overall participation rate\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa047.88%, OR\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa01.18, p\\\\xc2\\\\xa0= .200). Moderator analyses revealed that the video led to higher rates of participation than the gif among White participants (OR\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa01.39, p\\\\xc2\\\\xa0= .031) and non-Hispanic participants (OR\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa01.35, p\\\\xc2\\\\xa0= .029) only, whereas the video led to lower rates of participation than the gif among students who did not disclose their race (OR\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.31, p\\\\xc2\\\\xa0= .010). CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to improve online survey participation should be balanced with possible downsides (e.g., added email length) and should be evaluated for differential performance among population subgroups prior to widespread implementation.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Methodology; Online surveys; Social media; Influencer; Sampling; Recruitment\\\\r\\\\n',\", '\\',b\\'Julia Naime, Arild Angelsen, Dawn Rodriguez-Ward, Erin O.

We examine participation in and anticipation effects of two collective, incentive-based initiatives in Ucayali, Peru. The first initiative is a local REDD+ project, the second is Peru\\'s National Forest Conservation Program (NFCP). Both initiatives were evaluated at an early stage of implementation, thus any effects are characterized as anticipation effects. We first examine the determinants of participation in the initiatives and find that household participation is negatively associated with agricultural income and positively associated with market access and previous experiences with external initiatives. Next, we use quasi-experimental methods and self-reflexive evaluations to examine impacts on land use and livelihoods. The results show no evidence of anticipation effects on income or land use. Self-reflexive evaluations indicate, however, that a total of 82% of the NFCP participating households perceive a positive effect on wellbeing, while only 39% of participants in REDD+ perceive a positive effect. The differences in perceptions of the two initiatives is attributed to design and implementation factors, including delayed payments, lack of transparency, and limited local input. The study demonstrates the value of self-reflexive evaluations for identifying intangible effects on wellbeing of conservation initiatives.\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Keywords: Deforestation; Payments for ecosystem services; Rural livelihoods; Impact evaluation; REDD+\\\\r\\\\n\\',', '\\',b\\'Yan Gao, Lu Chen, Zhihao Jia, Liangyu Zhao, Yuke Yang, Chenchen Liu,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Social participation and health in middle-aged and older empty nesters: A study on gender differences,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'SSM - Population Health,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'2024,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'101641,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'ISSN 2352-8273,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2024.101641.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827324000417)\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Abstract: Background\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'The growing population of middle-aged and older empty nesters is characterized by poorer health, and social participation (SP) has been shown to improve this situation.

United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16 is advocating for peaceful, accountable and inclusive institutions as one powerful channel to foster global development. Investing in health and health policies can potentially contribute achieving these objectives. After providing a conceptual framework, this article reviews the existing literature on the evidence of the role of health and health systems in promoting social capital and trust, political engagement and participation, and peace that closely relate to the objectives of Sustainable Development Goal 16. We provide evidence of a systematically positive impact of better physical and mental health on social capital, and on political participation, both contributing to the sustainability of inclusive democratic institutions. We also document that health and health systems can help supporting peace, both via the reduction of social inequality and grievances, and by reducing the disruptive effects of epidemic shocks. Overall, the study provides evidence that health and health systems can generate co-benefits outside the health domain by promoting social capital, political participation and peace.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Health; Health system; Institutions; Social capital; Political participation; Peace\\\\r\\\\n',b'Elke Jahn, Michael Neugart,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Do neighbors help finding a job?

Combining rich spatial information with administrative records, we find that a 10 percentage points higher neighborhood employment rate increases the probability of finding a job by 1.9%. Displaced workers not only benefit from neighborhood networks in terms of higher earnings and longer job stability but they are also more likely to find a job at the plant of a neighbor. These results indicate that neighbors refer workers to employers and that social norms are less likely to play a role.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Social networks; Job search; Neighborhood; Employment; Earnings; Plant closures\\\\r\\\\n',b'Julio Calder\\\\xc3\\\\xb3n,\\\\r\\\\n',b'The formalisation of property in Peru 2001\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x932002: the case of Lima,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Habitat International,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 28, Issue 2,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2004,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Pages 289-300,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0197-3975(03)00072-9.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397503000729)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: This paper deals with the policy set by the Peruvian government between November 2000 and December 2002, to legalise urban property and secure tenure in Metropolitan Lima. During this period, significant adjustments were made to the legalisation policy. The most important of these are: (i) establishing a link between the central government and local governments; (ii) unifying real estate registries; (iii) promoting real estate registries; (iv) campaigning to register constructions (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfactory declarations\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d); and (v) seeking to establish a link between title deeds and credit mechanisms. By means of these changes, the Peruvian State (post-Fujimori) has tried to give a technical function to the Commission on the Formalisation of Informal Property (COFOPRI) to replace the image of a policy that had been used politically for electoral purposes, under the Fujimori regime. Furthermore, the paper contributes recent outcomes on the policy proposals made by Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto which predicted that holders of title deeds would be able to obtain loans from private banks. This process, which has still not been consolidated, is described and reviewed below.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Secure tenure; Titles deed; Credit\\\\r\\\\n',b'Kanat Abdulla, Balzhan Serikbayeva,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Gender gaps in labor market outcomes in a resource-dependent country,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Resources Policy,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 90,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2024,\\\\r\\\\n',b'104685,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0301-4207,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.104685.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420724000527)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: In the present paper we examine gender gaps in labor market outcomes in a resource-dependent country, the issue that has received scant attention in the literature. Kazakhstan represents a unique context to investigate the impact of mineral dependence on gender equality. Employing micro-level Labor Force Survey data, the study empirically establishes that gender earnings gaps can be partly explained by industry effects, while regional, human capital, and social characteristics could play a minor role in accounting for earnings differences between male and female workers. Further analysis suggests that women in resource-dependent environments face greater disparities in earnings and occupational status. The Oaxaca-Binder decomposition reveals that a large part of the gender gap is unexplained by the differences in the observed characteristics of men and women which could be associated with unobserved factors not included in the analysis. However, the potential for gender discrimination here seems to be quite significant.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Resource-dependence; Gender equality; Occupational mobility\\\\r\\\\n',\", \"',b'Justin Tyndall,\\\\r\\\\n',b'The local labour market effects of light rail transit,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Journal of Urban Economics,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 124,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2021,\\\\r\\\\n',b'103350,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0094-1190,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jue.2021.103350.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094119021000322)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: Many US cities have made large investments in light rail transit in order to improve commuting networks.

I propose a new instrumental variable to overcome endogeneity in transit station location, enabling causal identification of neighbourhood effects. Light rail stations are found to drastically improve employment outcomes in the surrounding neighbourhood. To incorporate endogenous sorting by workers, I estimate a structural neighbourhood choice model. Light rail systems tend to raise rents in accessible locations, displacing lower skilled workers to isolated neighbourhoods, which reduces aggregate metropolitan employment in equilibrium.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Transportation; Transit; Residential choice; Neighbourhood change; Spatial mismatch\\\\r\\\\n',\", '\\',b\\'David Mart\\\\xc3\\\\xadn-Barroso, Juan A.

To do this, we estimate commuting functions by incorporating four types of determinants: the characteristics of the workers, the jobs (or hiring firms), and the municipalities where the workers reside and work, including the unemployment rates to account for disequilibria in their respective local labour markets. After developing a simple model, we estimate these functions based on labour commuting microdata obtained from the population census of Spain for the years 2001 and 2011, periods with important changes in the labour market situation. We estimate commuting functions by means of ordered probit functions. The results show that the duration of commutes has not changed drastically. Additionally, most of the incorporated determinants maintain their sign and change their intensity only slightly over time. The duration of commutes is greater in the case of men, singles, educated and foreign workers, living in rented housing, using public transport, living or working in large cities, and working in large firms. In the same way, commutes are longer when the worker\\'s municipality of residence has a high unemployment rate, and they turn out to be shorter when the municipality of the workplace has a low unemployment rate. Finally, the changes in the unemployment rate, especially in the municipality of residence, have been compensated by variation in their respective parameters, consequently offsetting their effects on commute times.\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Keywords: Commuting; Labour matching; Labour market situation; Microdata; Spain\\\\r\\\\n\\',', \"',b'Obinna C.D.

This paper draws on a unique dataset combining individual commuting and wage information for working-class residents of London, circa 1930, to analyze, for the first time, the nature of and returns to commuting shortly after when networks were first built. A sizeable majority of working-class Londoners worked within a short walk of their residence in 1890. By 1930, over 70 percent commuted at least one kilometer. Commuting allowed workers to search for jobs over a wider geographic area and across a larger number of potential employers. This, in turn, potentially increased workers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bargaining power and improved employer-employee matching. We show that wage returns to commuting were on the order of 1.5\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x933.5 percent per kilometer travelled. Access to public transport increased both the probability of commuting and distance commuted but had little or no direct effect on the probability of being employed or on earnings. We argue that these results are consistent with a search and matching framework; commuting led to workers finding jobs more suited to their skills and to better matches with employers. We also provide descriptive evidence from contemporary sources to describe the impact of commuting on improving quality of life by reducing urban crowding.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Commuting; Labor markets; Earnings; London, GIS, 1930\\\\r\\\\n',\", \"',b'Diego Hernandez, Martin Hansz, Renzo Massobrio,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Job accessibility through public transport and unemployment in Latin America: The case of Montevideo (Uruguay),\\\\r\\\\n',b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 85,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2020,\\\\r\\\\n',b'102742,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102742.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692319308695)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: Accessibility to job opportunities is one of the factors that explains labor outcomes. For developing countries, public transport plays a key role in providing the population with access to employment opportunities. This paper aims to quantify accessibility by public transport to employment in Montevideo, Uruguay and to explore how accessibility to job opportunities via public transport relates to unemployment. To do so, we calculate a cumulative measure of accessibility to job opportunities for 1063 small zones\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94approximately 4\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x936 blocks each\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94within Montevideo. This measure yields accurate data on accessibility and can be assigned to individual households. Accessibility in Montevideo is unevenly distributed among social strata and is concentrated within the central (and wealthier) areas of the city. In addition, a multilevel logistic regression analysis indicates that greater accessibility to jobs via public transport is associated with a lower probability of being unemployed. This finding suggests that improving accessibility to job opportunities via public transit may enhance individual labor outcomes.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Latin America; Montevideo; Public transport; Accessibility; Urban employment\\\\r\\\\n',\", '\\',b\\'Shamim Noor, Pawinee Iamtrakul,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"Women\\'s access to urban public transport: Toward addressing policy constraints in combating sexual harassment,\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Transport Policy,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Volume 137,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'2023,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Pages 14-22,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'ISSN 0967-070X,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.04.010.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X23000975)\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"Abstract: Women\\'s physical harassment in public transport (PT) and public spaces is a pervasive and pressing issue across the globe. In developing countries, women\\'s easy access to public transport and harassment-free travel in urban areas have been hindered by a combination of factors. These include gender stereotype behavior, sociocultural stigma, poor transport settings, and a male-dominated transport sector. As a result, women often face numerous acrimonious experiences in their everyday mobility. In light of these issues, this study seeks to analyze existing literature to gain a deeper understanding of how gender roles and women\\'s positions in society shape travel behavior, as well as explore how gender-responsive policy interventions can effectively ensure an inclusive urban transport system for female commuters in developing countries. Through qualitative narrative analysis of previous research, the study aims to frame a conceptual relationship framework, which focuses on identifying micro to macro-level constraints and emphasizes the importance of gender-responsive policy interventions. The study expects that this framework will provide insight into how gender-responsive transport policies and women\\'s participation in the transport sector can address constraints in transit environments. Furthermore, this study will assist in initiating measures to correct the gender-blind approach and provide a solid basis for policy advice in the arena of public transport and gender.\\\\r\\\\n\",b\"Keywords: Developing countries; Gender-responsive transport policy; Public transport; Sexual harassment; Socio-cultural perceptions; Women\\'s mobility\\\\r\\\\n\",', \"',b'Daniel Johnson, Marco Ercolani, Peter Mackie,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Econometric analysis of the link between public transport accessibility and employment,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Transport Policy,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 60,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2017,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Pages 1-9,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0967-070X,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2017.08.001.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X16303353)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: Modern transport policy analysis has ceased to be mainly about transport impacts and is now focussed on the effects of provision and policy upon the operation of the economy and society. For people on the edge of the labour market, many of whom do not have access to other forms of transport, public transport is a very important source of accessibility to jobs. This analysis addresses what we see as a key research gap in Britain - whether there is a systematic variation in the level of employment at the local level with the quality of the public transport network. To address this we apply regression analysis to explain employment as a function of accessibility and other local labour and socioeconomic variables. Our data were based on a cross-section of output areas from the English part of the 2011 Census. We found a statistically significant relationship suggesting that, all else being equal, areas with shorter public transport times were associated with higher employment levels.\\\\r\\\\n',\", \"',b'\\\\xc3\\\\x80ngel Cebollada,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Mobility and labour market exclusion in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 17, Issue 3,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2009,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Pages 226-233,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2008.07.009.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692308000690)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: This article analyses the relationship between daily mobility and labour market exclusion.

By linking together and increasing the size of labour markets, the matching between individuals and jobs is improved, and the productivity increases. Communities and municipalities lobby for investments that lead to higher accessibility and those that are successful often see inflows of people as a consequence. This paper looks at the entire Swedish railway network, at the level of service of each station and at the connectivity among stations during the morning peak hour, considering different time bands. Associations between job accessibility levels and socio-demographic features are explored and disclosed, looking at the longitudinal impacts of railway investments over 4 years (from 2011 to 2014) on annual wages. Estimating a fixed effects model, very small effects on wages have been found with the increase in the number of jobs around accessible rail stations. These preliminary results indicate that additional jobs along the rail network seem to have a marginal effect. The findings of this analysis, if communicated to planners, may assist them in assessing the effects of future railway measures to implement over the Swedish territory.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Keywords: Railway improvements; Job accessibility; Labour markets; Connectivity; Railway impacts; Wages\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"Marisol Silva-Laya, Natalia D\\'Angelo, Elda Garc\\\\xc3\\\\xada, Laura Z\\\\xc3\\\\xba\\\\xc3\\\\xb1iga, Teresa Fern\\\\xc3\\\\xa1ndez,\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Urban poverty and education.

Results show that, despite attending school, the urban poor are not able to fully satisfy their right to education. Their educational achievement is deficient in terms of learning, educational trajectory and the capacity to aspire to a better future and although they are included in schooling, material deprivation combined with socio-territorial characteristics and cultural and administrative obstacles means that this inclusion occurs in a stratified manner.

These neighborhoods are characterized by economic vulnerability, social marginalization, and inaccessibility of basic services. The aim of this study is to provide evidence about the environmental risk factors faced by these populations in Argentina, and to identify whether their greater exposure to risk factors is associated with greater accessibility of healthcare services. We analyzed an original database that provides information about basic characteristics of the neighborhood, environmental risk factors (proximity to garbage dumps, industrial waste, and high-voltage towers), and accessibility of basic healthcare services on over 2000 informal settlements in Argentina. We calculated descriptive statistics and developed multivariate econometric models to estimate the probability of accessibility of healthcare services. On average, 31% of informal settlements were close to a garbage dump, 19% were close to a high-voltage tower, and 10% were close to industrial waste. In addition, 39% of these neighborhoods do not have a healthcare center nearby, 65% do not have an accessible hospital, and 39% are not consistently served by ambulances in the event of an emergency. The econometric estimates suggest that the accessibility of hospital healthcare service and to an ambulance service is positively associated with the age of the neighborhood, and whether the neighborhood is a slum, but there is no evidence of association with the exposure to environmental risk factors. In short, the populations living in informal settlements in Argentina are exposed to harmful environmental risk factors. Access to basic healthcare services is limited and does not reflect the elevated exposure to environmental risks. Health, environmental, and economic dimensions should be considered when designing and implementing public policies for vulnerable populations.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Keywords: Informal settlements; Slums; Environmental health; Urban health; Health services; Poverty; Argentina\\\\r\\\\n\\',', '\\',b\\'Ali Hosseini, Brandon Marc Finn, Ali Momeni,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"The complexities of urban informality: A multi-dimensional analysis of residents\\' perceptions of life, inequality, and access in an Iranian informal settlement,\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Cities,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Volume 132,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'2023,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'104099,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'ISSN 0264-2751,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2022.104099.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275122005388)\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"Abstract: Informal settlements constitute a prominent form of urbanization across the world. The rapid growth of Yazd presents an example of informal urbanization in Iran at the nexus of development, poverty, and inequality. While scholarship on urban informality is abundant, a lacuna exists in the literature on systematic quantitative research on informality among urban residents. The present study investigates residents\\' perceptions regarding informality and captures their responses before and after the expansion of an informal settlement in Yazd. Through this quantitative research, we aim to articulate and highlight specific domains of informality, offering a framework assessing the complexities of informality that extend beyond only Iranian informal settlements. This paper analyzes the status of urban informality and migration in terms of their social, economic, physical, environmental, and urban management characteristics in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAirport Neighborhood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d, a prominent Yazd neighborhood. This paper seeks to add theoretical and empirical depth to the categorization of distinct yet overlapping domains of informality. Our quantitative approach to migration and informality informs our central research question: How does the complexity of informality affect different groups of people living in one informal settlement? We find that recent migrants to the settlement are less involved in urban governance, women experience improved work opportunities after moving to the informal settlement but remain marginalized, and insufficient and poorly maintained infrastructure operates as a significant barrier to socio-economic stability and mobility. We also find that urban settlement results in increased debt among residents in Airport Neighborhood, and that youth unemployment is a significant issue that did not improve for recent migrants to the neighborhood despite young people citing employment as a key motivating factor for migration. Our empirical work highlights the theoretical complexity of informality, as subgroups of people face varying challenges that correlate with their age, gender, and time spent in a particular informal settlement.\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Keywords: Informal settlement; Informality; Urbanization; Developing countries; Yazd; Migration; Development; Inequality\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Ellis Adjei Adams,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\"Intra-urban inequalities in water access among households in Malawi\\'s informal settlements: Toward pro-poor urban water policies in Africa,\\\\r\\\\n\",b\\'Environmental Development,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Volume 26,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'2018,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Pages 34-42,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'ISSN 2211-4645,\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2018.03.004.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464517302178)\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Abstract: Poor access to potable water remains one of the most troubling challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s informal settlements (or slums) where majority of the poor and vulnerable urban population lives. While prior research shows significant disparities in water access between urban and rural areas, little is known about intra-urban inequalities and whether they are influenced by household socio-economic status. This paper draws from household surveys in three urban informal settlements in Lilongwe, Malawi, to explore intra-urban differences in water access based on water source, volume of water per capita, total time/day spent fetching water, and affordability of primary water source. It first compares the proportion of respondents that have access to water based on Malawi\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (national) and the United Nations and World Health Organization\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (international) minimum standards. It then uses linear and logistic regressions to examine socio-economic inequalities in water access. The results show inconsistencies in the proportion of households that satisfy Malawi versus the United Nations and World Health Organization minimum water-access standards. Household socio-economic status (SES) significantly influenced water access, underscoring the need for pro-poor water policies that recognize that even among households in predominantly poor and under-resourced urban settings, significant socio-economic differences underlie inequalities in water access.\\\\r\\\\n\\',b\\'Keywords: Intra-urban inequalities; Water access; Lilongwe; Malawi; Urban informal settlements; Pro-poor urban water policies\\\\r\\\\n\\',', \"',b'James Kwame Mensah,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Electricity and informal settlements: Towards achieving SDG 7 in developing countries,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Energy Research & Social Science,\\\\r\\\\n',b'Volume 93,\\\\r\\\\n',b'2022,\\\\r\\\\n',b'102844,\\\\r\\\\n',b'ISSN 2214-6296,\\\\r\\\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102844.\\\\r\\\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629622003474)\\\\r\\\\n',b'Abstract: Despite many academic discussions on the importance of sustainable and reliable energy to informal settlement dwellers, there is limited evidence on the delivery of electricity in informal settlements, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using the concept of tactical urbanism, this study examined electricity delivery and access to informal settlement dwellers in Accra, Ghana as an important component of meeting SDG seven. The paper analyses evidence collected through three focus group discussions of thirty informal settlement dwellers in three communities in Accra. The findings showed that whereas access to electricity in informal settlements has improved significantly, this increase is a result of corruption and connivance with electricity officials and that informal settlement dwellers pay exorbitantly to access and use electricity. This paper contributes to the growing body of scholarship on sustainable electricity in urban informal settlements in the Global South by documenting the experiences of informal settlement dwellers in Accra, Ghana.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Informal settlement; Electricity; Sustainable development goals; Sub-Saharan Africa; Ghana\\\\r\\\\n',\", \"',b'Godfred O.

Despite this persistent challenge and its impact on health and well-being, there are scarce comprehensive, standardized, and validated instruments for measuring housing insecurity in these regions. Therefore, our objectives were to develop and validate a housing insecurity scale for slums and informal settlements in the global South. Using a complementary set of qualitative and quantitative techniques, we developed the scale from data collected from three slums in Ghana (N\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa01036) on housing deprivations and characteristics, slum severity, resource insecurity, health outcomes, and socio-demography. Following item generation, domain identification, and content validation, we identified a set of 28 items, which were tested for tetrachoric and Biserial correlations. We then extracted an optimal number of factors and tested for dimensionality using confirmatory factor analysis and second-order confirmatory factor analysis. This was followed by tests of reliability, external validity, unidimensionality of sub-scales, local independence, invariant item ordering, and monotonicity. The resultant scale is a multilevel, multidimensional scale comprising 17 items that subdivide into three sub-scales: lack of essential utility (\\\\xce\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.63), built environment deficiency (\\\\xce\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.80), and tenancy challenges (\\\\xce\\\\xb1\\\\xc2\\\\xa0=\\\\xc2\\\\xa00.82). The composite scale is reliable, with a coefficient alpha of 0.83. Criterion concurrent and predictive validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and known group comparisons supported the validity of the scale. Assumptions of sub-scale unidimensionality, local independence, invariant item ordering, and monotonicity were verified. This is one of the few comprehensively validated scales developed to measure housing insecurity in slums and informal settlements in the global South. It can be used to test different hypotheses on the impact of housing insecurity on several environmental and health outcomes; assess and plan clinical, programmatic and policy interventions; and aid in tracking progress made on the Sustainable Development Goal 11.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: global South; Housing insecurity; Scale development; Slums; Informal settlements; Validation\\\\r\\\\n',b'Martina Olcese, Paola Cardinali, Francesco Madera, Andrew P.

This scoping review aimed to evaluate psychological and social science literature concerning community resilience in migrant communities. We employed the PRISMA methodology to evaluate literature from different databases. A total of 782 articles were identified, with 17 meeting the inclusion criteria and the characteristics of these studies (type of migrants, design, purpose and main results) regarding community resilience are presented. The findings cover a variety of factors that might promote community resilience and thematic analysis generated five themes: economic aspects, community competence, information, social capital and beliefs and attitudes. Based on our findings, suggestions for researchers are discussed and the importance of the host context in promoting migrant community resilience is highlighted.\\\\r\\\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Refugees; Community resilience; Acculturative stress; Scoping review; Community psychology; Trauma\\\\r\\\\n'\"]\n"
