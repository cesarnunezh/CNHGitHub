Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Charlotte de Fraiture, Dennis Wichelns,\\r\\n', b'Satisfying future water demands for agriculture,\\r\\n', b'Agricultural Water Management,\\r\\n', b'Volume 97, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 502-511,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0378-3774,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.08.008.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837740900239X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The global demand for water in agriculture will increase over time with increasing population, rising incomes, and changes in dietary preferences. Increasing demands for water by industrial and urban users, and water for the environment will intensify competition. At the same time, water scarcity is increasing in several important agricultural areas. We explore several pathways for ensuring that sufficient food is produced in the future, while also protecting the environment and reducing poverty. We examine four sets of scenarios that vary in their focus on investments in rainfed agriculture and irrigation, and the role of international trade in adjusting for national disparities in water endowments. Rainfed agriculture holds considerable potential but requires adequate mechanisms to reduce inherent risks. Irrigation expansion is warranted in places where water infrastructure is underinvested such as sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia the scope for improving irrigation performance and water productivity is high. International trade can help alleviate water problems in water-scarce areas, subject to economic and political considerations. We examine also a regionally optimized scenario that combines investments in rainfed and irrigated agriculture with strategic trade decisions. Compared to \\xe2\\x80\\x98business as usual\\xe2\\x80\\x99, this scenario reduces the amount of additional water required to meet food demands by 2050 by 80%. Some of that water could be made available for the environment and other sectors. We conclude that there are sufficient land and water resources available to satisfy global food demands during the next 50 years, but only if water is managed more effectively in agriculture.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Irrigation; Food security; Rainfed agriculture; Global outlook; Scenario analysis\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Abdul-Lateef Balogun, Olawale Emmanuel Olayide, Ulisses M.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Developing cities; Policies; Poverty; Vulnerability\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Marie T.

The unfolding global financial crisis, which brings higher unemployment and underemployment, is likely to further intensify this vulnerability. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban compared with the rural poor to these types of shocks. It reviews some of the unique characteristics of urban life that could make the urban poor particularly susceptible to price and financial shocks and summarizes the evidence regarding the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban poor. The focus is on impacts on poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. The review shows that although the urban poor are clearly one of the population groups most affected by the current (and previous) crises, the rural poor, landless, and net buyers are in no better position to confront the crisis without significant suffering. The poorest of the poor are the ones who will be most affected, irrespective of the continent, country, or urban or rural area where they live. The magnitude and severity of their suffering depends on their ability to adapt and on the specific nature, extent, and duration of the coping strategies they adopt. A better understanding of how these coping strategies are used and staggered is critical to help design triggers for action that can prevent households from moving to more desperate measures. Using these early coping strategies as early warning indicators could help prevent dramatic losses in welfare.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n', b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kwok Yan Chi Jackie,\\r\\n', b'Projecting Sustainable Living Environment for an Ageing Society: The Case of Hong Kong,\\r\\n', b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 17,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 675-684,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.084.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029613000868)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: In 2030, 22% of Hong Kong's total population will be aged 60 or older. In order to advocate Active Ageing1 in a qualified and sustainable environment, our research team has continuously investigated the habitable urban living environment for elderly people in Hong Kong. In 2009, we have completed a research on the practice of everyday life of an active group of elderly people. This research aimed to firstly understand how people aged 60 or above live actively in an urban environment; and secondly, to see if they are leading a quality life in Hong Kong. With this conceptual framework in mind, we wished to relate the environmental context to the ageing society. We organized the findings of this research into a conceptual framework to assess the use of urban space in Hong Kong. We wished to find out whether the use of it was fit for providing a qualified life for the older people. We find that while Hong Kong is a liveable city offering a vibrant city life, it is at the same time a \\xe2\\x80\\x98dual city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 where the high spending \\xe2\\x80\\x98nouveau riches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is gradually expelling the poorer citizens not only from the downtown area, but also from maintaining an affordable quality of living. Our findings strongly suggested that ageing is not a barrier to an active social life. In reality, poverty is the major factor that creates both helpless and hopeless feelings among the elderly people. In order to construct a sustainable environment which is \\xe2\\x80\\x98growing old\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the Hong Kong Government should integrate the concern of the older citizens into urban planning and design policies. The most important issue is to make the city life more affordable to all.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Sustainable Living Environment; Ageing society; Active Ageing; Quality of Life; Hong Kong\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gilberto Mahumane, Peter Mulder,\\r\\n', b'Urbanization of energy poverty?

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Luis Huicho, Eddy R Segura, Carlos A Huayanay-Espinoza, Jessica Ni\\xc3\\xb1o de Guzman, Maria Clara Restrepo-M\\xc3\\xa9ndez, Yvonne Tam, Aluisio J D Barros, Cesar G Victora,\\r\\n', b'Child health and nutrition in Peru within an antipoverty political agenda: a Countdown to 2015 country case study,\\r\\n', b'The Lancet Global Health,\\r\\n', b'Volume 4, Issue 6,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages e414-e426,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2214-109X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(16)00085-1.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X16000851)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Background\\r\\n', b\"Peru is an upper-middle-income country with wide social and regional disparities.

We obtained information on social determinants of health, including economic growth, poverty, unmet basic needs, urbanisation, women's education, water supply, fertility rates, and child nutrition from the annual national households surveys and the Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys. We obtained national mortality data from the Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, and calculated subnational rates from 11 surveys. Analyses were stratified by region, wealth quintiles, and urban or rural residence. We calculated coverage indicators for the years 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x9313, and we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to estimate the effect of changes in intervention coverage and in nutritional status on mortality.\\r\\n\", b'Findings\\r\\n', b'From 2000 to 2013, under-5 mortality fell by 58% from 39\\xc2\\xb78 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 16\\xc2\\xb77. LiST, which was used to predict the decline in mortality arising from changes in fertility rates, water and sanitation, undernutrition, and coverage of indicators of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health predicted that the under-5 mortality rate would fall from 39\\xc2\\xb78 to 28\\xc2\\xb74 per 1000 livebirths, accounting for 49\\xc2\\xb72% of the reported reduction.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Silvia M.

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Cellular automata; Urban expansion; Global south; Remote sensing; Land cover change; Predictive modelling\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n', b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 67,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters.

Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Komali Yenneti, Sabyasachi Tripathi, Yehua Dennis Wei, Wen Chen, Gaurav Joshi,\\r\\n', b'The truly disadvantaged?

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Michael B.

In the former category are key social agreements, for example, that urban development will be primarily carried out by the private sector, constrained only by planning laws that are mostly in the domain of local and state governments. Examples in the latter category include efforts to solve specific urban problems such as inadequate and unaffordable housing for low-income populations, or to respond to infrastructure deficiencies in transportation. All three countries in North America \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the United States, Canada, and Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are federal in their governance structure, so policy is necessarily distributed across the levels of government. As a result, central government plays only a limited role in key aspects of urban growth, though in Mexico there is a stronger tradition of centralization of policy. Within this framework, urban policy is diverse, but falls into three broad groupings. First, land use and development underpin urbanization; policy in these areas has existed from the earliest days in all three countries, exemplified by regulation of urban form. In North America, such regulation has, to varying degrees, supported market driven development. Second, urban policy deals with management of key functions, exemplified by transportation, public health, utilities, and environmental quality. Such policy occurs at all levels of government. Third, urban policy addresses social issues that have varied over time from the acculturation of immigrants, to poverty, housing, and race relations.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Federalism; Housing; Infrastructure; Land use; Planning; Policy; Poverty; Race; Transportation; Urban\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n', b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 132,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'105001,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Paul Milbourne, Shane Doheny,\\r\\n', b'Older people and poverty in rural Britain: Material hardships, cultural denials and social inclusions,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Rural Studies,\\r\\n', b'Volume 28, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 389-397,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0743-0167,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2012.06.007.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016712000691)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This paper explores the relations between older people, poverty and place in rural Britain. It develops previous work on rural poverty that has pointed both to the significance of older people within the rural poor population and to their denials of poverty. The paper also connects with recent discussions on the complexity of relations between poverty and social exclusion in later life, as well as key themes emerging from studies of older people in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods. Drawing on findings from a survey of 4000 households in rural Wales and interviews with older people in poverty in three rural places, the paper provides a detailed examination of the materialities and experiences of poverty among older people in rural places. In particular, it highlights how older poor groups construct their lives in complex terms with references made to both social inclusions and exclusions. The research also points to the significance of the socio-cultural contexts of place in shaping older people's understandings of poverty in rural areas.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Older people; Poverty; Social exclusion; Place; Rural\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Joanna L.

Meeting these challenges offers a means of furthering understanding and providing new insights into the geography of urban poverty and deprivation. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to mapping and analysing spatio-temporal patterns of household deprivation, assessing the distribution at the landscape level. The approach we develop has advantages over existing techniques because it is applicable in situations where i) conventional approaches based on choropleth mapping are not feasible due to boundary change and/or ii) where spatial relationships at a landscape level are of interest. Through the application of surface mapping techniques to disaggregate census count data, and by applying spatial metrics commonly used in ecology, we were able to compare the development of the spatial arrangement of deprivation between 1971 and 2011 in three UK cities of particular interest: Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool. Applying three spatial metrics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 spatial extent, patch density, and mean patch size \\xe2\\x80\\x93 revealed that over the 40\\xe2\\x80\\xafyear period household deprivation has been more spatially dispersed in Glasgow. This novel approach has enabled an analysis of deprivation distributions over time which is less affected by boundary change and which accurately assesses and quantifies the spatial relationships between those living with differing levels of deprivation. It thereby offers a new approach for researchers working in this area.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Spatial metrics; Surface mapping; Patterning of deprivation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Florence Dery, Elijah Bisung, Bernard Abudho, Ophelia Soliku, George Dery,\\r\\n', b'Examining the health and wellbeing of women sanitation workers in Ghana and Kenya,\\r\\n', b'Wellbeing, Space and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 5,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'100167,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2666-5581,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2023.100167.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666558123000404)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: About 3.6 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed sanitation service. To bridge service gaps, informal sanitation businesses have emerged as alternative service providers to meet the sanitation needs of unserved populations. Informal sanitation workers include persons who empty septic tanks, clean toilets, sewers, and manage public toilets. They provide a fundamental public service particularly in areas where access to municipal sanitation service is limited. Through qualitative methodologies, this paper explores the lived experiences and associated health risks of women working in the informal sanitation sector in urban Ghana and Kenya. Our findings show that female informal sanitation workers were exposed to injuries and infections, stigma and discrimination, emotional and psychological distress, sexual harassment, and unhealthy coping strategies. Distinctively, younger female participants were more likely to experience sexual harassment. Because of social stigma, many of the women developed unsafe work practices such as refusal to wear PPE and working at night. By paying close attention to the embodied effects of informal sanitation work, we can better comprehend the daily politics, lived experiences, and urban social infrastructure regimes that have a significant impact on the quality of life of informal sanitation workers. The results are also crucial for developing programs for women's empowerment and labour and social protection policies, especially in lowincome settings where gender norms interact with income disparities and other sociopolitical issues to affect women's participation in the labor market.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Informal work; Qualitative approach; Sanitation; Health\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n', b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n', b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n', b'Volume 33,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'100626,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n', b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 172,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'106388,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n', b'Amare Molla Dinku, Tefera Chane Mekonnen, Getachew Shumye Adilu,\\r\\n', b'Urban food systems: Factors associated with food insecurity in the urban settings evidence from Dessie and Combolcha cities, north-central Ethiopia,\\r\\n', b'Heliyon,\\r\\n', b'Volume 9, Issue 3,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'e14482,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2405-8440,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14482.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023016894)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: In Ethiopia, food security and vulnerability assessments have traditionally focused on rural areas. Recently, the issue of urban food security has been attracting attention in global policy debates. However, limited studies are found in the study areas that link food insecurity with major food market chains in the urban food system settings. This study is therefore, aimed at measuring the status of food insecurity in the urban food systems. A mixed study design has been used with randomly selected 506 resident households in Dessie and Combolcha cities, of north-central Ethiopia. We used a pre-tested, semi-structured survey questionnaire to collect quantitative data. The qualitative data has been collected with key informant interview, and focus group discussion among food system actors and facilitators in the selected commodities. We applied Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) to measure the food security status and narration and summarization techniques to analyze the qualitative data. The study confirmed that 33.1% of the respondents were food insecure. Moreover, nine and six individuals per 100 people were forced to \\xe2\\x80\\x98sleep hungry\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98not eat in the whole day and night\\xe2\\x80\\x99 respectively. Households' food insecurity was significantly associated with the gender of the household head, participation in casual labor, and living house ownership. The degree of food insecurity was deemed to be higher due to weak food system governance, an inconsistent food supply chain, and socio-economic and gender inequalities. However, both formal and informal food systems have their own unique qualities and maximum food security benefit can be achieved if they are well integrated. This implies food security intervention in urban areas needs to refocus their strategies towards systematic and integrated approaches that can promote social security programs like: urban housing, job security, urban agriculture and inclusive food safety net programs. Moreover, multidimensional studies are still important to obtain a wider picture of sustainable urban food security in urban areas and to better integrate the formal and informal food systems.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban food system; Associations; Food insecurity; Mixed research design; North-central Ethiopia\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Besma Belhadj,\\r\\n', b'New fuzzy multiple regressions for the instantaneous and panel data \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe determinants of Poverty in the Countries MENA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,\\r\\n', b'Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,\\r\\n', b'Volume 615,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'128565,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0378-4371,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2023.128565.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437123001206)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Habitually, to determine the effect of certain economic and social variables on poverty in MENA, a classical multiple regression with a framework defined a priori verifying several limiting assumptions and easily misused is used.

To achieve these ambitions, researchers should engage with communities, practitioners, and policy makers in a virtuous circle of research, policy, implementation, and active citizenship using the principles of co-design, co-implementation, co-evaluation, and co-translation. This Viewpoint provides an integrated perspective on the challenges that hinder the delivery of health-enhancing UGBS and recommendations to address them. Our recommendations include: strengthening the evidence beyond cross-sectional research designs, strengthening the evidence base on UGBS intervention approaches, evaluating the effects on diverse population groups and communities, addressing inequities in the distribution and quality of UGBS, accelerating research on blue space, providing evidence for environmental effects, incorporating co-design approaches, developing innovative modelling methods, fostering whole-system evidence, harnessing political drivers, creating collaborations for sustainable UGBS action, and advancing evidence in low-income and middle-income countries. The full potential of UGBS as public health, social, economic, and environmental assets is yet to be realised. Acting on the research and translation recommendations will aid in addressing these challenges in collaboration with research, policy, practice, and communities.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jian Nan XING, Wei GUO, Sha Sha QIAN, Zheng Wei DING, Fang Fang CHEN, Zhi Hang PENG, Qian Qian QIN, Lu WANG,\\r\\n', b'Association between Macroscopic-factors and Identified HIV/AIDS Cases among Injecting Drug Users: An Analysis Using Geographically Weighted Regression Model,\\r\\n', b'Biomedical and Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 27, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 311-318,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0895-3988,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2014.055.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398814600490)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Alicia C.

Using a novel dataset derived from the full Ghanaian Census, we investigate how neighbourhood versus household socio-economic status (SES) relates to a set of household development outcomes (related to housing quality, energy, water and sanitation, and information technology) in Accra, Ghana. We then assess \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstranger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d households' outcomes within neighbourhoods: do poor households fare better in affluent neighbourhoods, and are affluent households negatively impacted by being in poor neighbourhoods? Through a simple generalized linear model we estimate the variance components associated with household and neighbourhood status for our outcome measures. Household SES is more closely associated with 13 of the 16 outcomes assessed compared to the neighbourhood average SES. For 9 outcomes poor households in affluent areas fair better, and the affluent in poor areas are worse off. For two outcomes, poor households have worse outcomes in affluent areas, and the affluent have better outcomes in poor areas, on average.

Government and stakeholders in the clean energy sector have been making efforts to increase the availability and accessibility to clean energy technologies for cooking. This study aims to analyse the determinants and constraints associated with the adoption of improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Ghana using a sample of 194 respondents purposively selected. By applying the logistic regression and non-parametric models, the study revealed that household size, education of the household head, availability of stoves and the intensity/ frequency of use impact adoption decisions. Furthermore, affordability, low level of awareness, accessibility, and poor quality of stoves are the ranked constraints hindering the widespread adoption of ICS. These findings have implications for consumers, stove manufacturers, financiers, promoters and the government. Strategies aimed at improving stove quality and promotional activities including training and public awareness through the media and public fora need to be vigorously pursued by stakeholders to ensure energy for all.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Determinants; Improved cook stoves; Fuel; Urban households; Ghana\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Laura A.

These interventions are considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplex\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in that they have many mechanisms of change and related outcomes. Few HVIPs clearly identify the underlying mechanisms of intervention and explicitly link those with key outcomes however, limiting the field\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to know what works best and for whom.

To aid researchers, evaluators, students, and program developers, we describe the use of Grounded Theory as a methodology to enhance the development of complex interventions, illuminating a non-linear approach that engages key stakeholders. To illustrate application, we describe a case example of The Antifragility Initiative, a HVIP in Cleveland, Ohio. The development of the program theory of change was conducted in four phases: (1) review of existing program documents, (2) semi-structured interviews with program developers (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa06), (3) a focus group with program stakeholders (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa08), and (4) interviews with caregivers and youth (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa08).

The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former owners' land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which should help to reduce poverty in future generations.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Property rights; Land titling; Natural experiment; Urban poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Md.

While there are some skepticism toward urban agricultural activities in providing food for the urban markets, this study has nevertheless explored the existing evidence of its effectiveness in providing food security among urban dwellers and consequently reducing a large share of their food bills. Interviews of 360 households shown a positive statistical association between obtaining a sufficient quantity of food and adequate diet through engagement in urban agriculture. The results from this study indicate that food security can be derived from urban agriculture since it provides sufficient quantities of food, appropriate nutrition, cost-effective food supplies and reduction in food bills.

Yet these policies have not protected Portland from broader trends that have increased urban poverty over the past several decades in the U.S., including social welfare cuts and the shift in the economy to the service sector. In terms of poverty dynamics and social policies, we argue that while regional planning and other progressive policies have helped protect Portland from extremely high concentrated poverty present in many large U.S. cities, it has still experienced growing social dislocations associated with national and macro-level social and economic factors. These trends suggest both the possibilities and limits of local policy, regional planning, and activism for ameliorating the deleterious consequences of social welfare retrenchment and franchise capitalism for vulnerable urban populations, and highlight the importance of the broader social policy context and economic change for understanding urban poverty and the experiences of the urban poor.\\r\\n\", b'\\n', b'Penlope Yaguma, Hakimu Sseviiri, Priti Parikh, Yacob Mulugetta,\\r\\n', b'Asset ownership and electricity access in the urban informal settlements of Kampala, Uganda,\\r\\n', b'Energy for Sustainable Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 76,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'101294,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0973-0826,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2023.101294.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082623001515)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Delivering on the promise of SDG7 for low-income communities will require that we appropriately measure energy access. However, common measures use narrow indicators which do not acknowledge that poor households draw on multiple assets to access electricity. Using the asset pentagon of DFID's sustainable livelihoods framework, this study investigated asset ownership in a slum in Kampala, Uganda in relation to electricity access. Data were collected using household surveys [n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0450], and a multidimensional index and regression models applied to deduce asset ownership with respect to electricity access. We find that asset ownership is weak, especially for financial and natural assets compared to human, social and physical assets where households are better off. Grid-connected households exhibit stronger asset ownership than the unconnected, and assets also differ between residences, businesses, and mixed-use households. Households also interact with, manage, and leverage multiple assets to access electricity, depending on the ease with which those assets can be converted or exchanged for electricity. Policy and service provision should espouse existing everyday means of accessing electricity by capitalising on the assets in which households are strongest. Further, electricity provision goals for slums should be strongly linked with asset ownership and tangible livelihood outcomes for households, and exploring the micro-politics of electricity access and provision could offer directions for actualizing this linkage. Sustainable livelihoods approaches offer a valuable entry point for understanding energy access in deprived urban settings, from a perspective that encompasses multiple priorities for sustainable and inclusive urbanisation.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Livelihood assets; Electricity access; Slums; Informal settlements; Kampala; Uganda\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Yacouba Kassouri, Oluyemi Adewole Okunlola,\\r\\n', b'Analysis of spatio-temporal drivers and convergence characteristics of urban development in Africa,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 112,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'105868,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105868.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721005913)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Understanding the trajectory of urbanization and its drivers is particularly important in the new urban agenda set out under sustainable development goal 11 on cities and human settlements.

Moreover, among the determinants of conditional \\xce\\xb2-convergence, we show that natural resource rents and population contribute to urbanization significantly, while the effect of trade openness is insignificant. We also find that the relationship between urbanization and growth is inverted U-shaped, indicating that urbanization may decrease once a critical tipping point is breached.

This recognition has led many cities, around the world, to engage more actively in food policies and programs. The literature documenting this experience is largely case study-based and primarily covers actions and outcomes in larger cities. We analyze the overall state of urban food policy across Asia, drawing attention to distinctive patterns across city size categories and testing hypotheses which may explain the diversity of observed patterns of food policy engagement. Particular attention is given to demographic, institutional, and geographical factors which have likely influenced either the motivation or the capacities of cities to act on food matters. We find that most Asian cities are at an early stage in efforts to apply coherent and coordinated approaches to address food-related challenges and opportunities. The opportunities for future economic gain and avoidance of social costs may be greatest among the region's fast-growing small- and medium-sized cities, yet many such cities lack the requisite capacities to influence complex food system matters and will require assistance from national agencies and others.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Cities; Asia; Urban food policy; Food systems; Food smart; Benchmarking\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ashley Schram, Ronald Labont\\xc3\\xa9, David Sanders,\\r\\n', b'Urbanization and International Trade and Investment Policies as Determinants of Noncommunicable Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases,\\r\\n', b'Volume 56, Issue 3,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 281-301,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0033-0620,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2013.09.016.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062013001692)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: There are three dominant globalization pathways affecting noncommunicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): urbanization, trade liberalization, and investment liberalization. Urbanization carries potential health benefits due to improved access to an increased variety of food imports, although for the growing number of urban poor, this has often meant increased reliance on cheap, highly processed food commodities. Reduced barriers to trade have eased the importation of such commodities, while investment liberalization has increased corporate consolidation over global and domestic food chains. Higher profit margins on processed foods have promoted the creation of \\xe2\\x80\\x98obesogenic\\xe2\\x80\\x99 environments, which through progressively integrated global food systems have been increasingly \\xe2\\x80\\x98exported\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to developing nations. This article explores globalization processes, the food environment, and dietary health outcomes in SSA through the use of trend analyses and structural equation modelling. The findings are considered in the context of global barriers and facilitators for healthy public policy.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Globalization; Urbanization; Trade and investment; Unhealthy diet; Noncommunicable disease\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Warren Smit,\\r\\n', b'Urban governance and urban food systems in Africa: Examining the linkages,\\r\\n', b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 58,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 80-86,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2016.05.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026427511630083X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Urban food systems have increasingly been recognised as a topic that needs to be better understood, in order to address issues of urban food security and urban poverty. This is particularly so in Africa, which has high rates of urban population growth and high levels of urban food insecurity. There has, however, been surprisingly little work on examining the existing processes through which urban food systems are governed. In this article, based on a review of the relevant literature, I examine what we know about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa. The governance of urban food systems in Africa is complex, with a range of governance actors with competing agendas. These governance actors impact on urban food systems, and thus on urban food security, in a variety of ways, including: the impact on food production (e.g. urban and peri-urban agriculture); the impact on the distribution of food; the impact on the retail of food by formal and informal traders; and the impact on food safety. There are many gaps in our knowledge about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa, including: processes in secondary cities; the role of, and impact of, local governments on urban food systems; the impact of inadequate transport systems on food distribution; and the impact of supermarkets (and their expanding supply chains) on urban food systems. We need to better understand existing urban governance processes, and their impacts on urban food systems, in order to be able to collaboratively design interventions to improve urban food security in Africa.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Africa; Urban governance; Food systems; Food security\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'F.

Poor residential building thermal quality in the least advantaged neighbourhoods is a significant vector in inhabitant vulnerability. As this cross-cutting, complex problem must be broached comprehensively and on an urban scale, a methodology is proposed that would include a multidimensional fuel poverty index for application to deprived neighbourhoods. The method is illustrated with a case study for the city of Madrid, Spain. Data published by the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Urban Deprivation Observatory were cross-referenced with those from earlier studies to quantify fuel poverty and determine its spatial distribution. In future the findings will be related to basic indicators to formulate the nationwide list of deprived neighbourhoods and to the results of other fuel poverty-specific methodologies, from building energy inefficiency to those addressing causes and consequences. In addition to including the specifics of fuel poverty in urban deprivation analysis, the findings suggest that data from the observatories participating in the Urban Poverty Partnership might be cross-referenced with those of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV).\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Varsha S.

In other words, the higher the inequality in the income distribution, the lower is the growth elasticity of poverty. However, with the publication of Piketty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magnum opus (2014), and a subsequent study by Chancel and Piketty (2017) of evolution of income inequality in India since 1922, the focus has shifted to the income disparity between the richest 1% (or 0.01%) and the bottom 50%. Their central argument is that the rapid growth of income at the top end of millionaires and billionaires is a by-product of growth. The present study extends this argument by linking it to poverty indices in India. Based on the India Human Development Survey 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9312 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a nationwide panel survey-we examine the links between poverty and income inequality, especially in the upper tail relative to the bottom 50%, state affluence (measured in per capita income) and their interaction or their joint effect. Another feature of our research is that we analyse their effects on the FGT class of poverty indices. The results are similar in as much as direction of association is concerned but the elasticities vary with the poverty index. The growth elasticities are negative and significant for all poverty indices. In all three cases, the disparity between the income share of the top 1% and share of the bottom 50% is associated with greater poverty. These elasticities are much higher than the (absolute) income elasticities except in the case of the poverty gap. The largest increase occurs in the poverty gap squared \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a 1% greater income disparity is associated with a 1.24% higher value of this index. Thus the consequences of even a small increase in the income disparity are alarming for the poorest.\\r\\n', b\"Keywords: Income inequality; Piketty's measure; FGT class of poverty indices; Inequality and poverty; India\\r\\n\", b'\\n', b'Nabila Asghar, Muhammad Asif Amjad, Hafeez ur Rehman, Mubbasher Munir, Reda Alhajj,\\r\\n', b'Achieving sustainable development resilience: Poverty reduction through affordable access to electricity in developing economies,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Cleaner Production,\\r\\n', b'Volume 376,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'134040,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0959-6526,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134040.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622036125)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Energy is indispensable to bringing off the growing human demand, and it is a challenging global issue to achieve sustainable development goals by using clean energy. The present study evaluates whether access to electricity helps decline poverty in developing countries. For this purpose, the impact of access to electricity on the total population, rural and urban populations on poverty have been analyzed from 1990 to 2020 in 82 developing countries. Empirical results are obtained through the non-linear Panel ARDL approach. The results show that rural and urban population's access to electricity to the total population proposes the inverted U-shaped relationship with poverty. As a result, increased access to electricity initially contributes to poverty but eventually causes it to reduce. Based on these findings, the study suggests that in order to combat poverty, the countries with poor access to electricity should grant everyone easy and affordable access to power.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Poverty; Electricity; Non-linear ARDL; Sustainable development goal; Developing countries\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jean Christophe Fotso, Nyovani Madise, Angela Baschieri, John Cleland, Eliya Zulu, Martin Kavao Mutua, Hildah Essendi,\\r\\n', b'Child growth in urban deprived settings: Does household poverty status matter?

There is a strong association between food poverty and stunting among children aged 6\\xe2\\x80\\x9311 months (p<0.01), while assets poverty and subjective poverty have stronger relationships (p<0.01) with undernutrition at older age (24 months or older for assets poverty, and 12 months or older for subjective poverty).

The data is drawn from a survey of 6453 households from 11 Southern African cities. The findings indicate that infrastructure access significantly predicted HFIAP and MAHFP scores. The regression analyses demonstrated that households with inconsistent or no access to a cash income, cooking fuel, medical care, electricity, or water had 11 times greater odds of being categorized as food insecure in the HFIAP and 8.5 times greater odds of having less than 12months of adequate food provisioning in the last year. Household income alone does not sufficiently account for these relationships. The correlation analyses demonstrate a strong association between all the LPI subscales and household food access. These results clarify the differential impact of social and physical infrastructure on household food security and demonstrate that the prevailing conditions of an urban environment may better explain (and predict) urban household food security than household income alone. This investigation emphasizes the central role that urban planning and development can play in reducing food insecurity in poor urban neighborhoods.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban; Food security; Poverty; HFIAS; MAHFP; LPI\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Bernard Gauthier, Waly Wane,\\r\\n', b'Bypassing health providers: The quest for better price and quality of health care in Chad,\\r\\n', b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n', b'Volume 73, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 540-549,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.008.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611003534)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper investigates individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bypassing behavior in the health sector in Chad and the determinants of individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facility choice.

Longer durations of time spent on housing assistance have led to debates around public housing as more of a cause than an effect of poverty spells. This article analyzes the determinants of exit among public housing residents. Using a sample from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics, this article ascertains the individual characteristics and neighborhood factors associated with longer spell durations. The results suggest that most public housing residents exit public housing in the first 5\\xc2\\xa0years. In terms of individual characteristics, spell length, age and income played a modest role in understanding public housing exits. In addition, neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty and median household income had significant positive effects on the odds of exiting public housing. However, the effect sizes of household characteristics and neighborhood conditions were relatively small when considering the post-1996 era of policy reform. The results suggest that public housing exits may largely be due to shifts in housing policy and social welfare programs rather than household characteristics and neighborhood conditions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Public housing; Poverty; Welfare; Spells; Neighborhoods\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Syed Ainuddin, Jayant Kumar Routray, Shabana Ainuddin,\\r\\n', b\"People's risk perception in earthquake prone Quetta city of Baluchistan,\\r\\n\", b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n', b'Volume 7,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 165-175,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2013.10.006.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420913000575)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Large parts of Pakistan lie within a seismically active Himalayan belt.

The survey has been conducted among 200 households, applying the simple random sampling method. The study explored the relationship among different variables including socio-economic status of the respondents using multivariate statistics. The results revealed that earthquake risk perception associates significantly with the people's age, income, education etc. Further, the perception of earthquake risk varies among different governmental and non-governmental organizations and community members. The survey results also reveal that people know the risks posed by earthquakes but have fatalistic attitudes towards the future predictions of the earthquakes.

This paper shows that the reform was primarily driven by the need to secure electricity supply and cut down tariffs. These national objectives ousted other issues, and notably those that find their expression at the urban level, among which the question of access to electricity in Metro Manila's urban poor communities. The central state withdrew its attention from the issue of electrification, and local actors had to react as they were confronted to social tensions and practices of pilferage. As a consequence, city governments and local administrations are getting involved in this issue, which opens the way to participation of civil society. This paper shows how the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crolling back\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the central state led to new partnerships and arrangements between the distribution utility, local governments and community organisations.

This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Yonas Alem, Gunnar K\\xc3\\xb6hlin, Jesper Stage,\\r\\n', b'The Persistence of Subjective Poverty in Urban Ethiopia,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 56,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 51-61,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.10.017.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13002295)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Using data spanning 15years, we study subjective and consumption poverty in urban Ethiopia.

Several individual, family, peer, community, and societal risk and protective factors determine or modify the risk of firearm violence. Specifically, there is a strong relationship between poverty, income inequality, and firearm violence; as such, interventions that influence upstream determinants of health by providing income support may hold much promise in affecting multiple domains of risk that are on the causal pathway to firearm violence. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews, we conducted a scoping review to examine the current state of evidence on the relationship between income support policies and risk of firearm violence. We searched 8 databases related to health and social sciences from inception through March 30, 2022, and placed no time, language, setting, or other publication restrictions on our search, as long as the study was quantitative or mixed-methods and addressed firearm violence specifically, rather than violence more broadly, as an outcome in relation to income support policies. We found 4 studies; of those, 3 were conducted in the United States and 1 in Brazil. All 4 found associations of policy-relevant magnitude between income support policies and reductions in risk of inter-personal firearm violence. We propose future opportunities to enhance the substantive scope and methodologic rigor of this field of research and inform policy and practice for greater impact.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Income; Poverty; Firearms; Guns; Violence; Social; Public; Policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Olalekan John Taiwo,\\r\\n', b'Determinants of peri-urban and urban agricultural locational choice behaviour in Lagos, Nigeria,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 39,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 320-330,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.02.003.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837714000234)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This article quantitatively assessed factors that shape locational choice behaviour of urban farmers. Three hundred questionnaires were randomly administered to farmers in ten localities with a view to identifying factors that shape their locational choice behaviour. The average number of farmers per locality was designated as the index of attractiveness and was correlated with six broad categories of factors identified by farmers as influential in urban agricultural site selection. These broad factors are proximity to water, proximity to residence, access to land, proximity to market, suitable fertile soils, and availability of labour. These factors were subsequently broken down to sixteen categories. Almost all the variables exhibited negatively significant correlations with the index of attractiveness. Urban farmers prefer sites which were closer to water, free with minimal lease and rental cost, and also sites with fertile soil that is closer to farmer's residence, where aggregate costs of production is minimal and labour relatively available. The results obtained can be used in mainstreaming urban agriculture into city planning while at the same time provide avenue for increased urban agricultural productivity.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Transportation cost; Urban agriculture; Distance; Urbanization\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Karen Clay, Joshua Lewis, Edson Severnini,\\r\\n', b'What explains cross-city variation in mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic?

This paper uses newly assembled historical data on annual mortality across 438 U.S. cities to explore the determinants of pandemic mortality. We assess the role of three broad factors: i) pre-pandemic population health and poverty, ii) air pollution, and iii) the timing of onset and proximity to military bases. Using regression analysis, we find that cities in the top tercile of the distribution of pre-pandemic infant mortality had 21 excess deaths per 10,000 residents in 1918 relative to cities in the bottom tercile. Similarly, cities in the top tercile of the distribution of proportion of illiterate residents had 21.3 excess deaths per 10,000 residents during the pandemic relative to cities in the bottom tercile. Cities in the top tercile of the distribution of coal-fired electricity generating capacity, an important source of urban air pollution, had 9.1 excess deaths per 10,000 residents in 1918 relative to cities in the bottom tercile. There was no statistically significant relationship between excess mortality and city proximity to World War I bases or the timing of onset. In a counterfactual analysis, the three statistically significant factors accounted for 50 percent of cross-city variation in excess mortality in 1918.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Influenza; Pandemic; Mortality; Air pollution\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Komali Yenneti, Sabyasachi Tripathi, Yehua Dennis Wei, Wen Chen, Gaurav Joshi,\\r\\n', b'The truly disadvantaged?

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Carl Johan Lagerkvist, Sebastian Hess, Julius Okello, Helena Hansson, Nancy Karanja,\\r\\n', b'Food health risk perceptions among consumers, farmers, and traders of leafy vegetables in Nairobi,\\r\\n', b'Food Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 38,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 92-104,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0306-9192,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.11.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919212001157)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Urban and peri-urban farming and supply chains are becoming increasingly important for delivering perishable produce to the urban centers of the developing world to meet the demands of a growing population. However, some production and handling practises and a short supply chain may expose consumers to substantial health risks. This study of consumers, peri-urban farmers, and traders attempts to quantify subjective risk judgments with regard to food safety hazards, and examines the extent of discrepancies in perceived risk relating to vegetables in domestic urban markets among the three groups. A conceptual model was developed to elicit subjective risk perceptions for a multidimensional construct. In general, differences were found between respondent categories in terms of both specific source risks and overall risks. Differences were also found with respect to the socio-demographic and structural determinants of the levels of perceived risks. These findings can help improve policies to promote food safety and reduce risky food handling along the supply chain, and present opportunities for change.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food health risk; Peri-urban farming; Consumers; Farmers; Traders; Risk perception; Vegetables; Short supply chains\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Abubakari Ahmed, Stephen Boahen Asabere, Ellis Adjei Adams, Zaid Abubakari,\\r\\n', b'Patterns and determinants of multidimensional poverty in secondary cities: Implications for urban sustainability in African cities,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 134,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'102775,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102775.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397523000358)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Urban poverty research on African cities has focused mainly on megacities and large metropolitan areas. Despite their critical role in Africa's urbanization and development, secondary cities have received limited scholarly attention. Studies on secondary cities are unidimensional and rely mostly on secondary information from national census data. Using Wa, a secondary city in Ghana, this study assesses spatial patterns and determinants of multidimensional poverty, measured by two metrics: multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI). Spatially explicit primary data were collected from 775 households differentiated into core and fringe neighbourhoods. Mean MPI was significantly lower in core neighbourhoods than in fringe neighbourhoods. However, we found no statistically significant difference in MEPI between core and fringe neighbourhoods. The distribution of MPI is variably influenced by location and space but not MEPI. Although MPI was generally low, most areas with low MPI still had high MEPI, suggesting that energy access may be major problem even in secondary cities with low poverty. MPI was largely influenced negatively by household size and education. There was a significant negative relationship between MEPI and the food consumption score, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between food security and energy poverty. Together, the findings imply that scaling up the adoption of clean cooking energy in secondary cities can play a key role in addressing multidimensional urban poverty and advancing urban sustainability.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Multidimensional poverty; New urban agenda; Energy; Urban sustainability; Secondary cities; Africa\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Laura Sara Wainer, Lawrence J.

This paper draws on an investigation of living conditions in Ciudad del Bicentenario, a large-scale housing project on the outskirts of Cartagena. Based on a sample of seventy-five lengthy semistructured interviews with low-income residents and ten other stakeholders, we reached three paradoxical findings that reveal the high costs of free housing: the immediate improvement of overall quality of life but the impoverishment of economic prospects; the dual social condition of the residents who felt socially and economically isolated but also shared a widespread perception of being \\xe2\\x80\\x98revueltos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or scrambled within the community of Ciudad del Bicentenario itself; and the growth of economic and physical informality in a project intended to counter the informal settlements in the inner city. These paradoxes reflect more than simple processes of impoverishment of living conditions: they demonstrate how this type of public policy systematically complexifies the daily life of relocated families. Sociologically, these findings reveal a new type of peri-urban poverty in the global South. We argue that the productive informalization of the formal housing projects constitutes a central, but previously understudied, aspect of what it means to develop equitable housing.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Low-income housing; Urban informality; Poverty alleviation; Homeownership; Latin America; Megaprojects\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'M.K.

Despite this reality, previous national inventories of fuel choices in these settlements were based on the most preferred fuel rather than the whole fuel composite used by the households. This paper, therefore, examines the fuel combinations that households in informal settlements of Kisumu City use and how their socio-economic characteristics influence their choice of these combinations. The paper is premised on the energy stacking theory. The study sampled 419 households from informal settlements of Kisumu City. Multinomial logistic regression is used to establish correlation between household characteristics and fuel combination choices. The findings show that majority of households in urban informal settlements of Kisumu City use multiple fuels for cooking, with charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas being the most commonly stacked fuels. Education does not have a strong correlation with fuel choices; whereas household size reliably predicts the choice of individual fuels. Household income significantly predicts the adoption of fuel stacks that have liquefied petroleum gas and charcoal. While increase in household income has a positive correlation with adoption of modern fuels, it does not lead to households dropping primitive and transitional fuels from their stacks. The study asserts that the energy stacking theory is a suitable basis for assessing the relationship between household-based socioeconomic determinants and fuel combination choices among residents of SSA cities. The reality of fuel stacking in urban informal settlements requires policies geared towards increasing access to modern household fuel technologies while incentivizing adoption of fuel-efficient biomass stoves.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy stacking; Household fuel; Informal settlements; Cooking fuels; Cookstoves\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ronghao Jiang, George C.S.

Studies of the growth and transformation of Chinese cities are characterized by continuing debates between those who insisted on the pivotal role played by the Chinese Party-state and others who envisioned urban China as moving decisively toward capitalism. This research examines the pattern and process of land marketization in urban China as a case to understand the interaction between the state and market forces in China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ongoing urban transformation. Statistical analysis of the data for the Chinese cities at and above the prefectural level for the years of 2003\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 has identified an uneven geography of land marketization effectively shaped by a localization of state-market interplay. A significant and positive correlation is found between the degree of land finance and extent of land marketization. The uneven geography of land marketization is significantly influenced by the legacy of the socialist planned economy as measured by the dominance of state-owned enterprises. However, the strength and direction of the correlation between the state and market are found to be contingent upon the level of urban economic growth. Spatial variation in land marketization is also shaped by the degree of openness, local state policies toward industrial vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis commercial and residential land supply, population density, and the size of the city. Findings of this research call for a theoretical reconsideration of the state-market relationship in urban transformation more attentive to local conditions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Land market; Land use type; Urbanization; State-market relation; Neoliberalization; Chinese cities at and above the prefectural level\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Eefke Mollee, Mari\\xc3\\xa8ve Pouliot, Morag A.

While urbanisation causes landscape changes, little is known of how this process affects the use of wild plant resources by urban populations. This study contributes to addressing this knowledge gap by exploring the prevalence and determinants of urban collectors of wild plants in Kampala, Uganda. During February to August 2015, 93 structured interviews were conducted in inner, outer, and peri-urban areas of the city. The findings in this study show that urban wild plants are used by almost half (47%) of the respondents, mainly for medicinal purposes but also as a complement to diets. The findings further indicate that residents with lower income, of younger age (<51years old), and predominantly living in peri-urban areas are more likely to be urban collectors. Seasonality appears to be of greater importance in collection of food plants than of medicinal plants. Overall, these findings indicate that wild plants occupy an important role in the livelihoods and traditions of Kampala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents, and we argue that this should be taken into account in urban planning projects.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Livelihoods; Natural resource management; Non-timber forest products; Safety net; Urban ecosystems; Human ecology\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Peter Warr,\\r\\n', b'Chapter 25 - Poverty Reduction and the Composition of Growth in the Mekong Economies,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Arsenio M.

The region is defined here as the seven economies that border the Mekong River: five countries, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam; plus two provinces of China, Guangxi and Yunnan. Very little empirical work exists on the quantitative relationship between the rate of poverty reduction in these economies and the rate and nature of their economic growth. This chapter, which focuses on the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors of these seven economies, examines whether the sectoral composition of growth is relevant for the rate at which poverty incidence declines, given the overall rate of economic growth. The results confirm that poverty reduction is strongly related to growth of real gross domestic product per person but that the sectoral composition of this growth is also important.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: poverty incidence; economic growth; Mekong economies\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Yuko Tsujita,\\r\\n', b'Factors that prevent children from gaining access to schooling: A study of Delhi slum households,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Educational Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 33, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 348-357,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0738-0593,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2012.08.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059312001095)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper examines the factors that prevent slum children aged 5\\xe2\\x80\\x9314 from gaining access to schooling in light of the worsening urban poverty and sizable increase in rural-to-urban migration.

The mixture model decomposes the marginal distribution of durables ownership across all households, into three conditional distributions (one each for lower, middle and upper classes), along with their weights in the population distribution, endogenously determining class membership. This approach provides a potentially deeper understanding of the dynamics of classes, in particular the lower class, than can be obtained using poverty lines or PCA alone. It avoids many well-known problems with expenditure data, ameliorates the impact of changing survey designs, and enables an analysis of the behavior and membership of classes over time. I use the mixture approach to show that the urban lower class in India became smaller but poorer during the 1990s.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Durable ownership; Consumption class; Relative poverty; Poverty line; Mixture model; EM algorithm; Indian poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b\"Marisol Silva-Laya, Natalia D'Angelo, Elda Garc\\xc3\\xada, Laura Z\\xc3\\xba\\xc3\\xb1iga, Teresa Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez,\\r\\n\", b'Urban poverty and education.

The review covers the period 1995\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 and includes 66 articles. The analysis addresses: a) the educational achievement of the urban poor and b) the conditions under which they receive education. Results show that, despite attending school, the urban poor are not able to fully satisfy their right to education. Their educational achievement is deficient in terms of learning, educational trajectory and the capacity to aspire to a better future and although they are included in schooling, material deprivation combined with socio-territorial characteristics and cultural and administrative obstacles means that this inclusion occurs in a stratified manner. The findings urge a reexamination of the discussion around the challenge of education in facilitating social mobility. Breaking the cycle between urban poverty and education requires multisectoral public policies with an equity perspective and the coordinated participation of various social actors.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Academic achievement; Equity and access; Aspirations; School segregation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Stuart Cameron,\\r\\n', b'Whether and where to enrol?

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rudo V.

Even though riverbanks are considered the most endangered ecosystems globally, they continue to face degradation through cultivation, putting pressure on land use. This study assessed socioeconomic determinants of participating in riverbank cultivation at the household level. Open-ended questionnaire was administered as the main data collection tool. Questionnaire survey data were collected from 244 households living in thirteen unplanned compounds. This was complemented with transect walks. Data was then analyzed using the logistic regression model to establish socio-economic drivers that significantly drove river and stream bank cultivation. The findings from the study show that riverbank cultivation promoted livelihoods of the poor, household head's age positively influenced riverbank cultivation, unprecedented levels of poverty, unemployment and education level strongly contributed to household's decision to cultivate on riverbanks for them to be food secure and generate income. Larger family households had higher demand for food consumption putting more pressure on riverbank cultivation for food provisions. Unclear land titles stood out as major challenge households faced, whilst male household heads had entitlement to agricultural land. Declining soil fertility led to low agriculture productivity driving households to cultivate riverbanks where soils were more productive throughout the year. The current land-use and agricultural policies are indifferent towards riverbank cultivation in Zambia, with the effect of encouraging the practice. The study recommends strengthening the enforcement of laws governing riverbank cultivation.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Agriculture expansion; Land use, Semi-arid environments, Sustainable livelihoods, Wetlands\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Manob Das, Arijit Das, Ashis Mandal,\\r\\n', b'Exploring the factors affecting urban ecological risk: A case from an Indian mega metropolitan region,\\r\\n', b'Geoscience Frontiers,\\r\\n', b'Volume 14, Issue 1,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'101488,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1674-9871,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2022.101488.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987122001414)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Assessment of ecological risk (ER) is a key approach to adapting and mitigating ecological deterioration in cities of developing countries. In developing countries, the ecological landscapes such as vegetation cover, water bodies, and wetlands are highly vulnerable due to rapid urban expansion. Therefore, urban ER (UER) assessment and its drivers are crucial to guide ecological protection as well as restoration. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of UER and the impact of urban spatial form on UER in the Kolkata Megacity Region (KMR), India. This study developed a UER index and used spatial regression models across the urban centres. The ER has been assessed at city scale as well as grid-scale (2\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa02\\xc2\\xa0km and 5\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa05\\xc2\\xa0km) from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that ER has substantially increased over the last 20\\xc2\\xa0years. The urban centres with very high and high ER substantially increased, i.e. from 21.95% in 2000 to 31.70% in 2020. Kolkata and its surrounding urban centres were mostly characterized by very high and high ER. ER was influenced by spatial variables (such as land use and landscapes pattern). However, remote sensing parameters were weakly related to ER. The spatial lag model (SLM) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8686) was found to be better fit model than spatial error model (SEM) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8661) and ordinary linear regression model (OLS) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8641). Thus, the findings of the study can improve research and a comprehensive framework for urban ecological resources and provide a scientific basis for urban ecosystem planning and restoration. In addition to this, it will guarantee the sustainable utilization of urban ecosystems.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban ecological risk; Kolkata metropolitan area; Ecosystem services; Ecological protection; Urban form\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Joanna Vearey, Ingrid Palmary, Liz Thomas, Lorena Nunez, Scott Drimie,\\r\\n', b'Urban health in Johannesburg: The importance of place in understanding intra-urban inequalities in a context of migration and HIV,\\r\\n', b'Health & Place,\\r\\n', b'Volume 16, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 694-702,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1353-8292,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.02.007.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829210000274)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Developing country urban contexts present multiple challenges to those responsible for ensuring the good health of urban populations.

These slums evoke a more or less stereotype impression of built environments: complex, high dense alignments of small makeshift or run-down shelters. However, this perceived characteristic morphology is neither globally homogeneous nor is this perception covering morphologic appearances of urban poverty in a comprehensive way. This research provides an empirical baseline study of existing morphologies, their similarities and differences across the globe. To do so, we conceptually approach urban poverty as places which provide relatively cheap living spaces serving as possible access to the city, to its society and to its functions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so called Arrival Cities. Based on a systematic literature survey we select a sample of 44 Arrival Cities across the globe. Using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with street view images and field work we derive level of detail-1 3D-building models for all study areas. We measure the spatial structure of these settlements by the spatial pattern (by three features \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building density, building orientation and heterogeneity of the pattern) and the morphology of individual buildings (by two features \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building size and height). We develop a morphologic settlement type index based on all five features allowing categorization of Arrival Cities. We find a large morphologic variety for built environments of the urban poor, from slum and slum-like structures to formal and planned structures. This variability is found on all continents, within countries and even within a single city. At the same time detected categories (such as slums) are found to have very similar physical features across the globe.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Informal settlements; Urban poverty; Building morphologies; Urban pattern; Remote sensing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xin Tong, Jae Hong Kim,\\r\\n', b'Concentration or diffusion?

This study examines how poverty distribution has changed in the Los Angeles-Long Beach Combined Statistical Area and why. More specifically, an investigation is made to capture the detailed changes of poverty rates in over three thousand census tracts over the last two decades and to identify driving forces behind these spatiotemporal changes by employing spatial regression models. Results show that high poverty areas have stretched over space, not in a way that expands their overall size but in a way that increases the degree of spatial fragmentation throughout the last two decades. The results also reveal that neighborhood poverty change is largely shaped by wealth clustering and other spatially-explicit processes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Neighborhood change; Poverty distribution; Wealth clustering; Southern California\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jonathan Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan D.

It also hampers the ability of planners to implement more equitable and just decarbonization pathways. Research has revealed that climate policies have imposed a financial burden on low-income and other vulnerable groups by increasing food and energy prices, leading as well to global inequality. Similarly, researchers have warned that in developing countries, emission mitigation policies could increase poverty rates and even frustrate progress towards universal access to clean energy. This research explores whether low-income social groups experience a 'double energy vulnerability', a situation that simultaneously positions people at heightened risk of transport and energy poverty. We investigate this 'double vulnerability' through original data collection via three nationally representative surveys of Mexico (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,205), the United Arab Emirates (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,141), Ireland and Northern Ireland (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,860). We draw from this original data to elaborate on the sociodemographic attributes, expenditure and behaviour emerging from energy and transport use, focusing on themes such as equity, behaviour and vulnerability. We propose energy and transport poverty indexes that allow us to summarize the key contributing factors to energy and transport poverty in the countries studied and uncover a strong correlation between these two salient forms of poverty. Our results suggest that energy and transport poverty are common issues regardless of the very different national, and even sub-national, contexts. We conclude that energy and transport poverty requires target policy interventions suitable for all segments of society, thus enabling contextually-tailored, just energy transitions.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Mobility poverty; Fuel poverty, equity; Climate policy; Energy policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Miguel Anto\\xc3\\xb1\\xc3\\xb3n, Juan Ventura Pern\\xc3\\xada-S\\xc3\\xa1nchez, Teresa Cancho-Soto, In\\xc3\\xa9s Segovia-Molina, Nuria D\\xc3\\xadez-Monge, Alfredo Cano,\\r\\n', b'Asthma control in children, socioeconomic inequality and health care,\\r\\n', b'Anales de Pediatr\\xc3\\xada (English Edition),\\r\\n', b'Volume 98, Issue 5,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'Pages 353-361,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2341-2879,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2022.12.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287923000819)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Introduction\\r\\n', b'Socioeconomic inequality (SEI) can adversely affect asthma control.

This is the case in Lagos, a megacity reportedly dominated by slum dwellers, with limited knowledge on residential choices of slum dwellers and its contribution to slum population growth. This study, therefore, investigated the movement pattern of slum dwellers, factors influencing the residential choices and reasons for the people to remain in the Lagos slums. Data was collected through questionnaires and focus group discussions in slums in Lagos. The findings show that movement to Lagos was the main cause of population growth in the slums. Furthermore, slums in Lagos serve as a sink and a final destination for slum dwellers. Also, the factors that attract most of the slum dwellers to the slums differ from those that made them wish to remain. The identified factors were based on the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, it is therefore important for the Lagos state Government to incorporate them in their slum management policies, especially when relocation of slum dwellers is the only alternative.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Population growth; Residential decision; Slum; Lagos\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rahul Pathak, Christopher K.

Our empirical strategy relies on long-term changes in poverty and access to bus transit at the neighborhood level in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We estimate the effect of bus transit access on poverty using fixed effects models to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Furthermore, we undertake several robustness checks using a combination of instrumental variable regression, subsample analysis, and propensity score matching. Our results indicate that, on average, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics, census tracts with better access to public bus transportation have a higher proportion of low-income households \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in both the central city and the suburbs.

The design of effective preventive interventions is complex and requires an integrative approach from evidence-based information analyzed through robust theoretical frameworks. We conducted a systematized literature review and qualitative framework-guided thematic analysis to identify social ecological factors affecting the prevention and exposure to zoonotic diseases. Although resources for research are limited in Latin America, we found several studies with relevant results. We extracted and interpreted 8 themes as factors affecting the prevention, transmission, and exposure to zoonosis.

Although previous theories have explained the factors affecting urban renewal, such studies have failed to identify the differences among the drivers of multifunctional types of urban renewal, leading generalized urban renewal policies to fail. To extend the urban renewal theory from a typological perspective, this paper presents a study that identified the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the multifunctional types of urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China. Multisource data, such as planning permits, were used to identify the urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China, between 2010 and 2020 as well as the prerenewal and postrenewal functions of these projects. The results indicate that 1) the regression model accuracy is 60.3\\xc2\\xa0% for urban renewal as a whole. The classification of urban renewal projects improves the goodness of fit of the regression model by 0.16. 2) Land location, land prices, and policies were found to exert a greater influence on urban renewal than other factors, indicating that public demand plays a weaker role in driving urban renewal projects than the government or developers do. 3) The major types of urban renewal can be categorized into three typical driving modes: government-oriented urban renewal, which includes new industrial and public service projects; production-oriented urban renewal, which includes the conversion of industrial land into commercial or residential functions; and consumption-oriented urban renewal, including new residential projects implemented to accommodate the housing needs of an increasing population. Urban planners and policymakers can apply the results to classify urban renewal projects and adopt appropriate strategies for each type to achieve reasonable resource allocation and sustainable development.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban renewal; Spatial governance; Driving forces; Planning permit; The Rent Gap Theory\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sabyasachi Tripathi,\\r\\n', b'Do cities favor female entrepreneurs?

The National Sample Survey (NSS) unit-level data are used for the analysis. The descriptive results show that women's proprietorship is much lower than its counterpart. The Probit regression results at the individual level show that women entrepreneurs do not have a bank account or computer but use the internet, are not registered under any act or authority, and do not expand considerably. They operate within household premises with a limited number of months and duration of a day, undertaking mainly contract basis. They also face several problems that hinder their activities. City-level factors such as work participation rate, consumption expenditure, higher levels of general and technical degrees, and vocational training are essential. The likelihood of becoming a female entrepreneur is negatively impacted by the two agglomeration variables of population size and participation in mixed activity. City-level poverty and inequality also adversely affect it. State-level Human Development Index, Gender Development Index, and Gender Inequality Index are also significant. Finally, we propose important policies to enable the city environment to improve women's entrepreneurship activities for higher and sustainable economic development.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Female; Entrepreneurship; Agglomeration; Poverty; Inequality; Development; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Lirong Hu, Shenjing He, Zixuan Han, He Xiao, Shiliang Su, Min Weng, Zhongliang Cai,\\r\\n', b'Monitoring housing rental prices based on social media:An integrated approach of machine-learning algorithms and hedonic modeling to inform equitable housing policies,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 82,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 657-673,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.12.030.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837718316429)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Housing rental price; Social media; Hedonic model; Multilevel determinants; Machine learning; Equitable housing policies\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Courtney Queen, Derick N.

To improve electricity savings, policies oriented towards efficiency in residential consumption, such as replacement of appliances or the construction of nearly-zero energy buildings, have been suggested and implemented. However, the potential relevance of urban structural characteristics, such as the increase in detached houses in sprawling residential areas, has not often been considered. The aim of this research is to analyse the relevance of living in a detached house located in a dispersed urban area to household electricity consumption. Thus, an electricity consumption model is estimated by using household socioeconomic variables and including urban characteristics as its determinants, such us the level of urban agglomeration or whether families live in detached-sprawling homes. The model is estimated by using 2014 Household Budget Survey (HBS) microdata and applying Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) as well as quantile regressions (QR) as econometric procedures. Endogeneity problems are corrected by means of instrumental variables. The results confirm that living in a detached house significantly increases electricity consumption, whereas urban agglomerations have the opposite effect. Sprawl is occurring rapidly in Spanish cities, and according to our results, it could constitute a relevant source of increase in electricity demand in the following years.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Household energy consumption; House characteristics; Urban sprawl; Urban energy efficiency\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Hyun Kim, Dujin Park, Gyu Seomun, Hyewon Kim, Kyle Maurice Woosnam, Bong Jik Kim,\\r\\n', b'Health justice and economic segregation in climate risks: Tracing vulnerability and readiness progress,\\r\\n', b'Health & Place,\\r\\n', b'Volume 84,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'103113,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1353-8292,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2023.103113.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829223001508)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Climate vulnerability can make urban space unhealthy and accentuate existing health (in)justice and (economic) segregation.

It has become increasingly evident that the dialog must expand to include mental health outcomes, and to shift focus to the facets of the urban environment that shape them. Population-based research is necessary, as empirical findings linking the urban environment and mental health have primarily derived from developed countries, and may not be generalizable to developing countries. Thus, the current study assesses the prevalence of mental health problems (i.e., depression, perceived powerlessness), as well as their community-based predictors (i.e., crime, disorder, poverty, poor sanitation, local social capital and cohesion), among a sample of 690 residents in three poor urban communities in Accra, Ghana. It uncovers that residents in poor urban communities in developing countries suffer from mental health problems as a result of local stressors, which include not only physical and structural factors but social ones. Social capital and social cohesion show complex, often unhealthy, relationships with mental health, suggesting considerable drawbacks in making social capital a key focus among policymakers.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Mental health; Social capital; Social cohesion; Urban poverty and disorder\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Wenjie Wu, Wenzhong Zhang, Guanpeng Dong,\\r\\n', b'Determinant of residential location choice in a transitional housing market: Evidence based on micro survey from Beijing,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 39,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 16-24,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2012.10.008.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397512000719)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Using a large-scale household survey and aggregated census data from Beijing, this paper develops a framework to empirically measure the relative impact of location characteristics versus individual characteristics in determining the residential location choices of households.

In addition, while some individual socioeconomic characteristics such as income, educational attainment, and ownership status have similar effects on location choices as in developed market economies, factors that characterize institutional forces still play significant roles in residential location choices.

Land Use (LU) and Land Cover (LC) are two types of cartographic data that are used to develop smart cities and monitor the environment. LULC classification can benefit greatly from successfully applying remote sensing Image Classification (IC) using high spatial resolution data. The acquisition of spatiotemporal data for LULC classification has been made more accessible because of recent improvements in spatial analysis and Deep Learning (DL) technology. Considering the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in related Computer Vision (CV) tasks and the enormous volume of remotely sensed data accessible, DL methods appear to be particularly promising for modelling many remote sensing problems. However, there are several issues with ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that have a significant impact on categorization performance. We propose a Reversible Residual Network (RAVNet), a hybrid residual attention sensitive segmentation approach, to precisely categorize LULC in this study. The suggested network is based on the VNet model, which extracts relevant information by mixing low-level and high-level Feature Maps (FM). The attention-aware features change adaptively to the integration of residual modules. Our system was tested on the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset, and the findings demonstrate that our architecture is competitive against other learning models.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Land use and land cover; Classification; Machine learning; Deep learning; RAVNet; Spatial analysis; Accuracy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gideon Baffoe, Sohail Ahmad, Ramjee Bhandari,\\r\\n', b'The road to sustainable Kigali: A contextualized analysis of the challenges,\\r\\n', b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 105,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'102838,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102838.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275120311860)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Rwanda, despite being a predominantly rural country, has remarkably performed in the post-conflict (late 1990s) period on the socio-economic fronts. Contemporary challenges in Rwanda's capital city, Kigali, are widespread informality, both in the economy and urban built environment. Informality significantly hinders human health and wellbeing attainment. This paper assesses the development trajectory of Kigali with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using mixed research methods, including field visit. In doing so, the study dwells on three theories; postcolonial urbanism, post-conflict state building and neoliberalism. The paper diagnoses informality, polarized health sector and governance, as critical limitations to the attainment of sustainable development in Kigali. It argues that urban development in post-conflict Kigali is deeply rooted in capitalist and neoliberal ideology, where the state functions as the architect and facilitator of wealth accumulation for the few elites. Based on the analyses of the current development patterns, inclusive governance is identified as a key intervention to achieve sustainable development in Kigali.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Kigali; Urbanisation; Health; Governance; SDG; Post-conflict urbanism\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Md.

To address this challenge micro-finance has been considered as an alternative option in different literatures. Bangladesh is no exception in this regard. This paper highlights that the urban poor living in diverse forms of settlements in Bangladesh are making use of micro-credit from NGOs for housing-related upgrading activities that is not officially targeted for housing microfinance, but for supporting livelihood strategies. Another model of housing finance presented in this paper is community group savings programme which has been operationalised in Bangladesh over the last few years and promoted especially through the urban development projects by international agencies. This paper is an attempt to identify the salient features of these two provisions of finance in low-income urban settlements of Bangladesh. The paper follows a tradition of research in understanding different modes of housing provision of the urban poor that is related with the access to different form of finance to improve the housing condition of the urban poor. To do so two different cases from Gopalganj and Khulna city are presented, analysed and compared to deepen the understanding of how housing finance is operationalised in practice.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Housing finance; Micro-credit; Group savings; Urban poverty; Bangladesh\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Suranjan Majumder, Subham Roy, Arghadeep Bose, Indrajit Roy Chowdhury,\\r\\n', b'Multiscale GIS based-model to assess urban social vulnerability and associated risk: Evidence from 146 urban centers of Eastern India,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 96,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'104692,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104692.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723003037)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Social vulnerability in this study is expressed by highlighting the different forms of social deprivation experienced by the urban inhabitants. This article proposes a fundamental approach to quantify social vulnerability and associated risk in urban areas. Here, urban social vulnerability (USoV) consists of three interconnected dimensions, i.e. exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Based on these three dimensions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the urban social vulnerability index (USoVI) was computed using 15 indicators. Therefore, using the GIS environment, a composite measure is applied to identify and map the spatial heterogeneity of USoV for the 146 urban centres in Eastern India. The results highlight that most urban locations experience moderate to high exposure, sensitivity and low adaptive capacity corresponding to high USoV. Moran's I result indicates that the adaptive capacity shows the largest spatial association, while sensitivity indicates the lowest Moran value with the least association.

Literature remarks that social capital seems to contribute to the endurance of such livelihoods, although the underlying mechanisms through which this capital operates in such context remain under-researched. This paper uses the example of fifteen ejidos located in a peripheral municipality notably affected by the expansion of Morelia, a middle size city in Michoac\\xc3\\xa1n, Mexico, to explore such mechanisms. Two main considerations were taken into account to fulfill this purpose. First, we assumed that social capital is the result of a social construction process, so it is the product of formal and informal institutionalized social relationships that promote feed-back loops of social engagement, trust and reciprocity that help to mobilize meaningful resources for mutual benefit. Second, we focused on the ejido as the unit of analysis since it is considered as one of the most important forms of social organization in the rural Mexico. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with their respective Comisariados ejidale\\xc5\\x9b presidents. Results show how ejidatarios engage and reciprocate inside the ejido. Also, they reveal the nature of the exchanges and their outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of local institutional and non-institutional arrangements in regulating access to, and distribution of, resources in peri-urban territories.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Social Capital; periurbanization; agricultural livelihoods; ejidos; peri-urban poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rishabh Kumar, Sriram Balasubramanian, Prakash Loungani,\\r\\n', b'Inequality and locational determinants of the distribution of living standards in India,\\r\\n', b'Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 61,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'Pages 59-69,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0954-349X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2022.02.007.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X22000169)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: We analyze consumption distribution in India purely on the basis of location \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a combination of the state and sector (urban, rural) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and find that it explains a third of the variation in living standards. Consumption is also shown to be positively related to locational inequality. The main reason is that in poorer locations, consumption is tightly (less unequally) distributed around a low level, making class a poor predictor of higher living standards compared to the aggregate. In effect, from an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective, living standards are higher in richer, but more unequal, locations in India. We analyze these paradoxes as evidence of an ongoing Kuznets type processes. Our results have implications for the persistence of economic migration within a fast-growing emerging economy.

It does so by describing challenges and opportunities for intervening to address these social determinants, and by presenting some potential approaches to the choice, design and evaluation of such interventions, especially in low and middle-income countries. Challenges include distal interventions, limits to the modifiability of some social and economic determinants, poorly understood mechanisms, difficulty defining the boundaries of such interventions, the need for inter-disciplinary and inter-sectoral collaboration, limited datasets in LMIC, sample size challenges for prevention interventions, ethical issues and siloed research funding. Potential approaches include the development of more robust causal models, trial designs that allow for analysis of mechanisms and the pooling of data across diverse settings to explore the role of contextual variables. Several criteria can inform the selection of interventions that target social determinants and these include the need for plausible mechanisms, feasibility, acceptability, cultural validity of moderator, mediator and outcome variables, generalizability and sustainability. These approaches require a high level of inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary cooperation and data sharing across sites internationally.

We provide both an in-depth exploration and analysis of the travel patterns and preferences of Nairobi residents and a discussion of the implications of these results for transport policy in this city. The data show that the lack of suitable transport infrastructure exacerbates travel challenges for residents across all income groups. A substantial portion of the local population cannot regularly afford any form of motorized transportation. They thus are forced to locate in slums near sources of employment, and the widespread lack of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure increases the risk that they face when traveling. The middle income group who cannot afford private cars is almost completely dependent on the informal public transport system, which provides good geographic service coverage at the expense of service quality. Approximately 15% of Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s households own cars. Our analysis shows that without policies that make non-motorized transport safer and public transport service better, car ownership and use will increase sharply as the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents become wealthier, further congesting already-overloaded roadways.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Africa; Public transport; Travel survey; Logit model\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n', b'3 - Interactions between obesity, economic growth, globalisation, urbanisation and poverty in Latin American and Caribbean countries,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n', b'Obesity Epidemic and the Environment,\\r\\n', b'Academic Press,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'Pages 45-87,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780323993395,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-99339-5.00005-4.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323993395000054)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This chapter focuses on the determinants of obesity and the interactions between these determinants and obesity. The main determinants considered are urbanisation, globalisation, poverty, and economic growth. A reinforcing effect is expected to be found between these determinants and obesity, so evidence of the nutritional transition in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries is expected. Using data collected for 23 LAC countries from 1990 to 2016 and estimating a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model regression, the results confirm the initial hypotheses. An increase in the prevalence of obesity is related to the rise of urbanisation, globalisation and poverty reduction, and it is also interrelated with economic growth.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Econometrics; Economic growth; Globalisation; Health economics; Income; Macroeconomics; Obesity; Poverty; Urbanisation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dauda Ayuba, Anna Yunana Akinga, Debra Ukamaka Okeh, Jerico B.

This has consequently led to an increase in urban poverty. The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of migration on rural and urban areas, challenges of urbanization, and food security of the urban poor, as well as to suggest ways to address the dilemma of the urban poor in Nigeria. This research consists of analytical work based on a survey of existing literature. The study observed that insecurity and conflicts are major drivers of rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban migration and a root cause of food insecurity; consequently, leading to urban poverty. It is suggested that government should as a matter of urgency address insecurity and conflict in order to arrest rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban migration, boost food security and reduce poverty in the country.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Food security; Urbanization; Urban Poor; Nigeria\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Alexandra Wollum, Sof\\xc3\\xada Gardu\\xc3\\xb1o Huerta, Oriana L\\xc3\\xb3pez Uribe, Camille Garnsey, S.

Abortion accompaniment, in the form of logistical, informational, and emotional support offered by individuals and organizations, takes a person-centered, feminist, and rights-based approach. We tested the extent to which abortion accompaniment may decrease negative and increase positive feelings an individual holds related to their abortion. Using observational longitudinal data collected between January 2017 and mid-2018, we compared negative and positive emotional responses to a personal abortion experience one month and six months following the abortion to emotions immediately prior to the abortion (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbaseline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), among women travelling from outside of Mexico City to abortion clinics in Mexico City with and without support of the accompaniment organization, Fondo MARIA. We used doubly robust longitudinal mixed effects models with inverse probability weighting methods. At baseline, accompanied and unaccompanied participants experienced an average of 4.9 and 4.4 negative emotions out of eight respectively (i.e., anguish, nervousness, scared, anxious, sadness, guilt, anger, shame) and 1.7 and 1.9 positive emotions of out 4 respectively (happiness, calmness, decidedness, and relief). From our model results, women accompanied (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa077) had larger decreases in negative feelings (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.05) and larger increases in positive feelings (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.01) toward their abortion compared to those who were not accompanied (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0119) at six months. These changes led the majority of accompanied respondents to have primarily positive feelings about their abortion by endline. Abortion accompaniment through Fondo MARIA in Mexico City was associated with a larger decrease in negative feelings, particularly those related to stigma, and a larger increase in positive feelings six months after abortion. Accompaniment's focus on person-centered support, self-determination, and autonomy may enable people seeking abortion to view their decision as one that is valid and legitimate, and resist the predominant stigmatizing narratives framing abortion as something that is transgressive.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Abortion; Accompaniment; Mexico; Emotions; Abortion stigma; Person-centered care\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sumila Gulyani, Debabrata Talukdar,\\r\\n', b'Inside Informality: The Links Between Poverty, Microenterprises, and Living Conditions in Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 38, Issue 12,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1710-1726,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.06.013.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X1000118X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Using households rather than enterprises as the analytical unit, this study of 1,755 households in Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slums reveals that informal household microenterprises are indeed helping offset poverty.

National policies to fight unhealthy eating have been implemented but they don't target social and family environment determinants. Our study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of unhealthy eating by exploring the perspectives and experiences of low-income Mexican women with a young child at home. We conducted a purposeful sampling to include participating kindergartens in Morelos, M\\xc3\\xa9xico. Women with a child enrolled in the kindergarten were invited to focus group discussions. Afterward, women with specific profiles were invited to in-depth interviews. During analysis we applied Dahlgren and Whitehead's model of social determinants of health (SDH). Overall, we found that participants have unhealthy habits, for example: low variability in consumption patterns, regular sugar-sweetened beverages intake and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake. By low variability we mean frequently consumed products (on most days of the week) limited to a restricted food set. As for the determinants of unhealthy habits, we found at the community level that families encourage unhealthy eating. At the household and work level, tight schedules for food preparation determine unhealthy eating. And, at a socio-economic level, lack of access and money constraints shape unhealthy habits. Unhealthy habits are determined by factors on multiple levels and using an SDH approach can be an effective way to inform comprehensive strategies targeting the overweight and obesity epidemic in Mexico and other low- and middle-income countries.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Unhealthy habits; Eating habits; Social determinants\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Singumbe Muyeba,\\r\\n', b'Institutional capital, urban poverty and household wealth in Cape Town,\\r\\n', b'World Development Perspectives,\\r\\n', b'Volume 16,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'100139,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2452-2929,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wdp.2019.100139.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452292919300013)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article identifies factors that explain urban poverty by focusing on the relationship between institutional capital and household wealth in Cape Town.

Although there is a concrete association with hunger, malnutrition doesn't always imply hunger or famine and is manifest in many forms, from chronic hunger to micronutrient deficiency, and from stunting to obesity. Key determinants triggering malnutrition encompass excessive intakes, insufficient food consumption or inadequate utilization of nutrients provided by foods that are consumed. Undernutrition is a term that includes stunting, underweight, wasting and having deficient levels of essential vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients). As such, it constitutes the malnutrition category that represents nutrient deficits. The other form of malnutrition is associated with excessive energy and nutrient intakes (which may also be accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies or suboptimal intakes), leading to obesity and other diet related non-communicable diseases. This article focuses on undernutrition and the triple burden that many countries face in dealing with both under and overnutrition.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Food security; Malnutrition; Micronutrient deficiency; Moderate acute malnutrition; Severe acute malnutrition; Stunting; Sustainable development; Undernourishment; Undernutrition; Triple burden\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mesele Belay Zegeye, Getamesay Bekele Meshesha, Muhammad Ibrahim Shah,\\r\\n', b'Measuring the poverty reduction effects of adopting agricultural technologies in rural Ethiopia: findings from an endogenous switching regression approach,\\r\\n', b'Heliyon,\\r\\n', b'Volume 8, Issue 5,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'e09495,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2405-8440,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09495.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022007836)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: The purpose of this study is to understand how the adoption of different agricultural technologies can reduce poverty in rural regions of Ethiopia. To attain this objective, this paper uses a comprehensive socio-economic survey of Ethiopia, which allows us to securitize the household level information. The paper uses a multinomial endogenous switching regression model to estimate the impact of alternative technologies adoption on poverty reduction on a sample of 2316 farm households, and a multinomial logit model to estimate the determinants of alternative agricultural technologies adoption. The results showed that the decision to adopt alternative agricultural technologies depends on several variables such as education, regional heterogeneity, remittance income, extension visit, credit access, off-farm activity, soil quality, farm size, tropical livestock unit, distance, plot's potential wetness, and ownership certification. The impact results of the study show that household consumption increases when households adopt alternative agricultural technologies, thereby reducing their poverty. Furthermore, adoption of a package of technologies can result in higher food and total consumption per adult than single technology adoption. The paper recommends strategies for further disseminating and scaling up these technologies to help reduce poverty in Ethiopia.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Agricultural technology; Rural Ethiopia; Poverty; Multinomial logit; Endogenous switching model\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Antonio Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez Andr\\xc3\\xa9s, Bidisha Chakraborty, Piyali Dasgupta, Siddhartha Mitra,\\r\\n', b'Realizing the significance of socio-economic triggers for mental health outcomes in India,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 50,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 50-57,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2214-8043,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2014.03.002.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804314000366)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of socio-economic triggers on mental health outcomes, proxied by male and female suicide rates.

Moreover, the white working-class has experienced a surge in socio-cultural isolation, and disengagement with societal institutions. This analysis focuses on the health consequences of these developments, with a particular emphasis on the rising \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeaths of despair\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (suicide, drug poisoning, alcohol related). These deaths have been increasing since the mid-1990s and, at least until recently, tended to be clustered amongst whites without a four-year college degree. Various competing explanations have been put forth, emphasizing distinct factors such as material conditions, socio-cultural dynamics, and accessibility to opioids. Using a series of linear models this analysis examines the county-level association between economic precarity, white working-class population size, opioid accessibility, and deaths of despair. Results affirm the net effect of each predictor and illuminate an interactive relationship between opioid accessibility and precarity, as well as an interactive relationship between all three predictors. By undertaking an interdisciplinary synthesis of existing research, this study contributes to the understanding of the social determinants of mortality while providing crucial insights into an ongoing crisis in contemporary America.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Economic insecurity; Mortality; Social determinants; Deaths of despair; Opioids\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ofuje Blessing Amune, Stacey Brown Amilian,\\r\\n', b'Inpatient mental health hospitalizations in the Chicago metropolitan area, IL, USA: A spatial and demographic analysis,\\r\\n', b'Social Sciences & Humanities Open,\\r\\n', b'Volume 8, Issue 1,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'100538,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2590-2911,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2023.100538.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291123001432)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matthew Desmond, Carl Gershenson,\\r\\n', b'Who gets evicted?

Using the theory of new institutional economics, this paper aims to answer two questions: what informal institutions secure the de facto tenure and facilitate the market? and How do informal institutions affect the pricing mechanism? We propose a conceptual framework to investigate the links between informal institutions, de facto tenure, and the price of informal housing. It is argued that villages have the ability to seek political patronage and regulate the market transactions to secure the tenure of informal housing. This ability is authorized by several formalities: the dual land system and the regime of village autonomy. The growing powers of market agencies in local development help strengthen the village's ability. The variances in ability between villages lead to a heterogeneity of tenure security, thus creating price differentials in the market. A higher tenure security increases the housing price. In conclusion, the informal housing market in China is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csemi-formal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system in which both informality and formality work and intertwine.

Yet, medical trainees remain underprepared to address the social determinants of health in practice, despite curricular innovations. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore how social determinants of health curricula is taken up by medical students. This study, which draws upon ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews at a medical school in the United States, explores how medical students understand their role in addressing social determinants of health. I find that epistemic invulnerability, defined as the closure to affect or to be affected in relation to others, generates feelings of helplessness, closure to alternate possibilities, and rigid professional boundaries that prevent medical students from incorporating the responsibility to act on the social determinants into their clinical purview. These findings provide novel epistemological context to better align health equity curricula in medical education with the aim to train physicians that both understand and address the social determinants of health.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Medical education; Epistemic invulnerability; Professional socialization; Health equity; Social determinants of health\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Laura Rodriguez-Takeuchi, Katsushi S.

In the olden days, most peop le were poor, and this was accepted as natural and unavoidable. The current understanding, on the contrary, is that the condition of poverty is unacceptable, and that it should be eradicated. This study investigates the impact of food security on urban poverty using Lagos state, Nigeria as a case study. The study reveals that four important proxies (high level of education, small household size, healthy households and high income,) for food security have huge impact on poverty and significant impact on urban poverty.

Literature on the interface of inner-city rearing, sustainable cities and urban governance dilemma is limited in African cities. Using the city of Wa in Ghana as a case, this study seeks to understand cattle-rearing practices, driving forces, the public health risk and governance challenges in African cities. The study employed a questionnaire to elicit data from 96 cattle keepers, while interviews were conducted with neighborhood residents and city authorities. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the quantitative data, and thematic analysis employed to analyze the qualitative data. The study found that cattle keepers are spread across the inner-city and keep indigenous, exotic, and crossbreeds. Open grazing and stall feeding were adopted in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The animals are kept in makeshift structures and open kraals. The holders earn substantial income, making demand for cattle the main determinant of farmers' decision to rear. Although the cattle pose a health risk and cause inconvenience to residents, political interferences and logistical constraints limit local authority's efforts to govern rearing in the inner-city. Based on the challenges and the benefits, city authorities might be faced with trying to strike a balance with sustainable cities' agenda. Therefore, actions towards harmony between livestock rearing, environmental sustainability and human safety are imperative for effective urban governance.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Livestock; Cattle; Sustainable cities; Urban governance; Ghana\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Abdul Latif Alhassan, Nicholas Biekpe,\\r\\n', b'Determinants of life insurance consumption in Africa,\\r\\n', b'Research in International Business and Finance,\\r\\n', b'Volume 37,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 17-27,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0275-5319,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2015.10.016.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027553191530057X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: We take motivation from the low insurance penetration in Africa to investigate the factors that influence life insurance consumption in 31 African countries from 1996 to 2010.

Fuels use in developing countries is heterogeneous across households. This paper estimates drivers of fuel switching in non-slum and slum households in urban India, using a discrete choice model on a nationally representative micro data. The choices considered are three categories of cooking fuels: traditional \\xe2\\x80\\x93 firewood, dung, crop residue and coal/charcoal; modern \\xe2\\x80\\x93 kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and mixed fuels. The results suggest that the patterns of fuels use are consistent with the energy ladder theory in urban India. In addition to income, the major determinants of modern fuels uptake are fuels prices, access to electricity and water supply, and education attainment. The increasing price of LPG affects the willingness to change fuels for low-income non-slum and the high-income slum households negatively. The analyses make a strong case for applying differential subsidies on modern fuels employing multidimensional aspects of poverty. Moreover, there is a need for partial diversion of existing fuels subsidies on improving physical and social capitals, which will result in uptake of modern fuels, particularly among disadvantaged communities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Cooking energy; Fuel switching; LPG; Slum; India\\r\\n', b'Sonia Alejandra Pou, Natalia Tumas, David S\\xc3\\xa1nchez Soria, Pablo Ortiz, Mar\\xc3\\xada del Pilar D\\xc3\\xadaz,\\r\\n', b'Large-scale societal factors and noncommunicable diseases: Urbanization, poverty and mortality spatial patterns in Argentina,\\r\\n', b'Applied Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 86,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 32-40,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0143-6228,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.06.022.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622816302351)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Introduction\\r\\n', b'In developing countries, the rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases burden has been accompanied by socio-demographic changes, such as rapid urbanization, with persistence of considerable socio-economic gaps between populations.

This article reviews the use of data in nonprofit organizations, including the types of data collected and accessed, the motivations for data capture, and the barriers to systematic use of data. The literature shows that nonprofit organizations capture a variety of data, including public and financial data, performance measures, program evaluation data, and volunteer information. Organizations use these with diverse motivations such as program or organizational improvement, marketing, and accountability. Prominent barriers faced by organizations include challenges in identifying meaningful information, lack of technical ability, inability to prioritize data work, as well as external influences. The article highlights the challenges in synthesizing the available literature, with a high degree of fragmentation, including research from distinct intellectual traditions resulting in many disconnected constructs, measurements, and theories.

This research finds the positive prospects for low-income neighborhood households to move up, while the characteristics (e.g., racial composition) of origin and destination neighborhoods play a significant role in relocation outcomes. In addition, housing mobility programs can have various impacts on households moving from neighborhoods of different income levels. Policymakers should be aware of the diverse needs of households in extremely low-income neighborhoods (less concentrated housing assistance) and in very low-income neighborhoods (public housing) that can help them move out of concentrated poverty and move up to neighborhoods with higher income spectrums.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Low-income neighborhood; Housing policy; Poverty; Urban governance\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jose G.

In this study, we proposed the use of online rental listings as a new reliable data source for mapping housing rent. With the collected individual rental information from an online platform, we attempted to produce the fine-scale spatial pattern of housing rent in the metropolitan area of Guangzhou, China, at the neighborhood committee (NC) level. This involves the task of estimating the housing rent for areas with no observation data of housing rent. To this end, we evaluated six numeric prediction methods of machine learning. We further enhanced their performance through ensemble learning, an approach which can form new classifiers with even better performance than any of the individual constituent classifiers. We implemented ensemble learning through ways of bagging and stacking, and selected the most accurate ensemble classifier to produce the spatial pattern of housing rent at the NC-level. In the resulting housing rent pattern, we identified a distance decay relationship between the housing rent and the distance from the city center. The data sources and the ensemble learning platform in this application of housing rent mapping are generally open access. Therefore, the proposed approach in this study can provide useful hints for housing rent mapping in other geographical areas. Our mapping results can also be integrated with additional information to support the studies of urban residential problems in China.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Housing rent mapping; Online rental listings; Anjuke; Ensemble learning\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Moritz U.G.

For example, connectivity among human populations, a key driver of pathogen dispersal, has increased sharply over the past century, along with the availability of data derived from mobile phones and other dynamic data sources.

Large amounts of capital continue to be spent on creating such spaces without adequate thought or resources for their long-term maintenance and management of public spaces, or place-keeping. While there may be continued policy rhetoric about the importance of place-keeping, particularly as public spaces are recognised for their important contribution to health, wellbeing, biodiversity and also their economic value, this has not however been supported in practice. There are examples in many cities where public spaces are subject to poor management and maintenance practices. This is clearly visible where vandalism, litter and damage to facilities and equipment occur, and people no longer feel safe or comfortable. This paper argues that this uneven focus on place-keeping is not only due to a lack of resources but also a lack of understanding of the concept, its complexity and the wide implications it has for users, practitioners and policymakers. The paper aims to address this gap in knowledge by providing a detailed exploration and definition of place-keeping within the urban context. Place-keeping is not simply about the physical environment, its design and maintenance, but also encompasses the interrelated and non-physical dimensions of partnerships, governance, funding, policy and evaluation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Design; Landscape; Maintenance; Place-making; Planning; Urban\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Abbas El-Zein, Samer Jabbour, Belgin Tekce, Huda Zurayk, Iman Nuwayhid, Marwan Khawaja, Tariq Tell, Yusuf Al Mooji, Jocelyn De-Jong, Nasser Yassin, Dennis Hogan,\\r\\n', b'Health and ecological sustainability in the Arab world: a matter of survival,\\r\\n', b'The Lancet,\\r\\n', b'Volume 383, Issue 9915,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 458-476,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0140-6736,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62338-7.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613623387)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Discussions leading to the Rio+20 UN conference have emphasised the importance of sustainable development and the protection of the environment for future generations. The Arab world faces large-scale threats to its sustainable development and, most of all, to the viability and existence of the ecological systems for its human settlements. The dynamics of population change, ecological degradation, and resource scarcity, and development policies and practices, all occurring in complex and highly unstable geopolitical and economic environments, are fostering the poor prospects. In this report, we discuss the most pertinent population\\xe2\\x80\\x93environment\\xe2\\x80\\x93development dynamics in the Arab world, and the two-way interactions between these dynamics and health, on the basis of current data. We draw attention to trends that are relevant to health professionals and researchers, but emphasise that the dynamics generating these trends have implications that go well beyond health. We argue that the current discourse on health, population, and development in the Arab world has largely failed to convey a sense of urgency, when the survival of whole communities is at stake. The dismal ecological and development records of Arab countries over the past two decades call for new directions. We suggest that regional ecological integration around exchange of water, energy, food, and labour, though politically difficult to achieve, offers the best hope to improve the adaptive capacity of individual Arab nations. The transformative political changes taking place in the Arab world offer promise, indeed an imperative, for such renewal. We call on policy makers, researchers, practitioners, and international agencies to emphasise the urgency and take action.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kalpana Gopalan, Madalasa Venkataraman,\\r\\n', b'Affordable housing: Policy and practice in India,\\r\\n', b'IIMB Management Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 27, Issue 2,\\r\\n', b'2015,\\r\\n', b'Pages 129-140,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0970-3896,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iimb.2015.03.003.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0970389615000336)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Affordable housing is a problem that many countries are taking stock of, world over.

However, educational decision-making may be sensitive to contextual factors such as economic deprivation, a dysfunctional welfare state or poor access to credit markets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 characteristics shared by most low- and middle-income countries. To better understand how economically disadvantaged individuals in developing countries make their educational choices, we conducted a survey based on a random sample with high school students in the rural department Moraz\\xc3\\xa1n in El Salvador, a lower middle-income country in Latin America. Our results show that regardless of the social background, almost all students aspire to pursue tertiary education, probably due to the high tertiary degree premium in earnings and the high social benefits. However, the lack of possibilities to finance their studies generally prevents the realisation of these aspirations for lower social background students. While in high-income countries, cost factors are not very important in the decision-making process, the burden of costs explains around 45 percent of the social background effect in El Salvador. Other factors such as academic confidence, expected future economic benefits, parental status maintenance wish, individual risk aversion and time discounting preferences play only a minor role.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Educational decision-making; Rational choice model; Tertiary education; Developing countries; Economic deprivation; Secondary effects of social origin\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Luisa M.

Based on an original dataset of 15,279 low-income households, this paper studies the incidence and determinants of illegality in the context of low-income urban favelas. The probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained not just by low income, but by a combination of concurring factors: sub-standard energy provision and equipment; inefficient/incorrect use of domestic electric appliances and running an informal in-house business. These recurrent issues in the urban favelas aggravate a sense of exclusion from growth, which is generally recognized as a trigger of illegality. The impact of energy demand on energy-related illegality is carefully analyzed, and different empirical strategies adopted to circumvent some simultaneity problem between both decision processes. The effectiveness of consumption-based energy subsidies is also explored. In spite of some contrary arguments in the literature, in the context of peri-urban slums, such measures may exert a positive impact in mitigating illegal access and use of energy. Effectiveness will be enhanced by accompanying measures such as: perceivable improvements of equipment, metering and maintenance, promotion of beneficiaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of energy usage, and energy-saving behaviors.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slum electrification; Energy consumption subsidies; Illegal electricity connections\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Nijika Shrivastwa, Brenda W.

Urban growth is less rapid than often assumed and consumption rather than production driven, while liberalized trade regimes have globalized food systems. Urban insecurity and rural poverty are handled through self-provisioning arrangements in both rural and urban areas, which may undermine the role of urban areas as sources of demand for rural produce. Smallholders in rural areas close to existing urban areas are likely to benefit most from growing markets for high value products. Food security must be the priority for marginal areas untouched by urbanization.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urbanization; Sub-Saharan Africa; Smallholders; Rural urban linkages; Food security\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Nancy Mock, Gaurav Singhal, William Olander, Jean-Baptiste Pasquier, Nathan Morrow,\\r\\n', b'mVAM: A New Contribution to the Information Ecology of Humanitarian Work,\\r\\n', b'Procedia Engineering,\\r\\n', b'Volume 159,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 217-221,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1877-7058,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.164.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816323128)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This paper reviews the World Food Program's experience using mobile cellular technology to monitor food insecurity in humanitarian settings.

While such approaches have either been resisted or condemned by affected households, state and city authorities have defended them as the most appropriate remedies. Have flood events been properly understood? Are flood management approaches aimed at addressing the problem? What are the actual effects of current flood management practices? In responding to these questions, this study seeks to: (i) examine the contours and politics of managing flood vulnerability in the city (ii) understand the factors that have shaped city government's responses to flood events; and (iii) explore the challenges within the current institutional and legal arrangements for flood management. Using Agbogbloshie and Old Fadama \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the largest slum communities in Accra - as cases, the study adopts mixed qualitative methods including: interviews of flood victims, focus group discussions, institutional consultations and review of government documents in gathering relevant empirical data. The study reveals that flood management approaches have been shaped by a complex network of actors with entrenched interests.

Using monthly data over the past decade, we estimate models of inflation to identify the importance of the factors contributing to CPI inflation and three of its major components: cereal prices, food prices, and non-food prices. Our main finding is that movements in international food and goods prices, measured in domestic currency, determined the long-run evolution of domestic prices. In the short run, agricultural supply shocks affected food inflation, causing large deviations from long-run price trends. Monetary policy seems to have accommodated price shocks, but money supply growth affected short-run non-food price inflation. Our results suggest that when analyzing inflation in developing economies with a large food share in consumer prices, world food prices and domestic agricultural production should be considered. Omitting these factors can lead to biased results and misguided policy decisions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Commodity prices; Ethiopia; Food policy; Food prices; Global food price crisis; Monetary policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'James Nguyen H.

The level of housing investment is measured through the type of physical structure of the house, or more specifically, floor materials. Cluster-robust standard error logistic regression method is utilized to explore this relationship in order to fix the issue of households located in the same settlement being correlated with each other. The results show that houses with greater tenure security, whether owner-occupied or rented out, are more likely than houses with insecure tenure to have cement floors, which are more permanent and expensive than other types of floors like bamboo, wood, or dirt/mud. Importantly, renters are more likely than owner-occupants to have cement floors. In sum, although greater tenure security may positively impact housing investment, the market force in which housing is seen as a business opportunity may be an equally strong factor in encouraging investment even in poor communities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Tenure security; Housing investment; Bangladesh; Real estate; Property rights\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Adeladza Kofi Amegah, Jouni J.K.

As a critical health exposure, social integration may be one important mechanism by which places affect health. This paper brings together research on two previously studied contextual determinants of social integration. Specifically, we use multi-level data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Survey to investigate the relationships between an individual's length of residence and measures of social integration. We then investigate the extent to which these relationships are moderated by neighborhood poverty. We find that the relationship between length of residence and some measures of social integration are stronger in poor neighborhoods than in more affluent ones.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Residential stability; Social support; Neighborhood poverty; Urban policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Woojin Kang, Katsushi S.

It draws on three rounds of national household surveys in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It is first observed that the pace of poverty reduction for minorities surpassed the majority over the period 2002\\xe2\\x80\\x932006, although poor people were still concentrated in the minority groups throughout the period. Secondly, the disparity in living standards has been widening. In particular, inequality within both the majority and minority groups increased over the period. Thirdly, the study shows that the effect of economic growth on poverty is estimated to have been greater if inequality remained constant. It is also noted that the impacts of economic growth on poverty vary across different ethnic groups. Finally, regression decompositions of within inequality have confirmed that the main driver of inequality is not the same among ethnic groups. Given the diversity across different ethnic groups, we can conclude that government policy aimed at equal access to infrastructure and more equal distribution of assets, such as land, for ethnic minority groups would lead to more equal distribution of consumption and poverty reduction of those groups. Also, consideration of local needs would be necessary in designing and implementing public policies, given the heterogeneous socio-economic circumstances surrounding each ethnic minority group.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Vietnam; Ethnic minority; Growth; Poverty; Inequality; Decomposition\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David B.

Transport-related mortality will increase as a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, air pollution and sedentary lifestyles. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) have proven to be a successful tool to predict and mitigate negative health impact of urban transport planning policies, programmes or projects. Yet, there is a gap of evidence on transport and health in African countries. The aim of this study is assessing the health impacts of transport scenarios in Port Louis (city of 119,018 inhabitants in Mauritius) using a full chain participatory HIA model.\\r\\n', b'Methods\\r\\n', b'We estimated health and economic impacts associated to transport scenarios with qualitative data and quantitative comparative risk assessment methods. The health impact modeling was based on differences between the baseline and three transport scenarios (worse, good, ideal), estimating the averted deaths per year and economic outcomes by assessing health determinants of air pollution (AP), traffic deaths and physical activity (PA). Data on air pollution and traffic fatalities were obtained from public data sources. Data used to construct scenarios, establish baseline travel mode shares and physical activity were collected through (a) open-ended individual interviews (IDIs) with 14 stakeholders (b) closed-ended survey questions to 600 citizens and (c) 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with the same 14 stakeholders from (a).\\r\\n', b'Results\\r\\n', b'In Port Louis, the worse-case transport scenario (doubling in car trips and a reduction in walking, motorcycle, and public transport), resulted in a total increment of 3.28 premature deaths per year.

Since Pakistan's energy production is mostly fossil fuel-based, the recent natural gas discoveries could potentially impact local industries and poverty. The past research has not explored the association between Trade, Poverty and Natural Gas production; therefore, this study investigates a nexus between trade, natural gas, and poverty in Pakistan for the period 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x932018. We applied the simultaneous equation method for data analysis. The results of the study suggest that trade liberalization and natural gas both increase industrial production, which, in turn, reduces the level of poverty in the country. Therefore, the government needs to further strengthen trade ties with neighbor countries and encourage the discovery of natural gas exploration to overcome ongoing energy shortage. Additionally, the government should find alternate sources of energy, like solar energy and wind energy.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Trade; Natural gas; Poverty; Pakistan\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sara McLafferty,\\r\\n', b'Spatial Mismatch,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

However, its cities are also settings for numerous struggles over future developments coupled with excess urban risks. The nexus created by the relationship between urbanization, urban growth, urban governance, poverty and inequality, and ecological degradation is altering the sustainability of urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities. Inspired by the United Nations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 11; making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, this study critically analyses the linkages between risk, justice, inclusion, trust and power relations in urban spaces with the aim to strengthen tourism governance in Sub-Saharan African urban settings. Document analysis is adopted to draw evidence and critically analyse the sustainability of tourism in the three Sub-Saharan cities: Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Harare, Zimbabwe. The study reveals that tourism development in Africa is dominantly underpinned by neoliberal development strategies which threaten the sustainability of tourism in African cities.

Using household (n=427 in 2006, 2009 and 2012) total income panel data sets, with and without environmental income, from Nepal, we analysed the importance of environmental income in household-level poverty assessments (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices) and dynamics (movements in the Poverty Transition Matrix). Random effects logit and ordered logit models were applied to estimate variables covarying with poverty categories and compared for annual household incomes with and without environmental income. Using the without environmental income data set significantly changed the number of households classified as poor, as well as rates of movements in and out of poverty. Excluding household-level environmental income also distorted estimation of covariates of poverty incidence and poverty dynamics. Poverty incidence and dynamics models including environmental income perform better than those without.

Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers' working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers' poverty as well as to farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: FGT; Rural poverty; Mixed methods; Logistic regression; Cooperative; Gender\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dein Vindigni, Barbara Polus, Joan van Rotterdam, Cliff da Costa, Gay Edgecombe, Max Walsh, Michael Howard, Tuesday Bromwell, Alma Biasbas, Marc Cohen, Charlotte Patterson,\\r\\n', b'The Sustainable Training, Treatment, Employment Program Model: Effects of Manual Therapy on Musculoskeletal Pain and Limitation in a Filipino Squatter Community,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 34, Issue 6,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 381-387,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0161-4754,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2011.06.003.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016147541100131X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Objective\\r\\n', b'The purpose of this study is to describe the musculoskeletal conditions and associated pain and limitation and the effects of massage treatment in a Filipino squatter community.\\r\\n', b'Methods\\r\\n', b'The study was conducted at the Hands On Philippines Education (HOPE) clinic in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan, Philippines.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Elisa Consolandi,\\r\\n', b'Chapter 1.3 - Evolution and intensity of infection in Lombardy,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Emanuela Casti, Fulvio Adobati, Ilia Negri,\\r\\n', b'Modern Cartography Series,\\r\\n', b'Academic Press,\\r\\n', b'Volume 9,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'Pages 41-49,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1363-0814,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780323910613,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91061-3.00008-9.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323910613000089)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: On a national scale, Lombardy is the region most intensely and severely affected by Covid-19.

This backbone may be said to have determined a regional bipartition, with a high intensity of contagion in less inhabited areas of Lombardy compared to metropolitan areas. As a matter of fact, the metropolitan area of Milan was initially spared and was severely hit only in the subsequent phase of contagion.

In 2008, the Mexican government launched a program where they matched funding from local partners to establish user-financed PWS, leading to the creation of 145 programs between 2008 and 2019. We study the factors related to the emergence and persistence of these local, user-financed PWS programs across Mexico. We assemble a unique database on these programs, as well as biophysical, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional variables, at the municipality level. We use logistic regression to analyze the variables correlated with the emergence and persistence of PWS. We find that PWS programs are more likely to emerge in municipalities with lower opportunity costs of forest conservation; that are wealthier; that have higher institutional capacity; and that have more collective land tenure and protected areas. PWS programs are more likely to persist in municipalities where watershed conditions are a concern; that have more wealth and institutional capacity; and that have a non-governmental organization or water utility involved as the local counterpart. These results suggest that emergence and persistence of local, user-financed PWS programs to address water security can occur when the opportunity costs of conservation are met; the provision of ecosystem services is enhanced; there are sustainable sources of financing; and there is institutional capacity that involves non-state actors.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Green infrastructure; Investments in watershed services; Nature-based solutions; Payments for ecosystem services; Pagos por servicios ambientales\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dieter Wang, Bo Pieter Johannes Andr\\xc3\\xa9e, Andres Fernando Chamorro, Phoebe Girouard Spencer,\\r\\n', b'Transitions into and out of food insecurity: A probabilistic approach with panel data evidence from 15 countries,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 159,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'106035,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106035.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2200225X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Recent advances in food insecurity classification have made analytical approaches to predict and inform response to food crises possible. This paper develops a predictive, statistical framework to identify drivers of food insecurity risk with simulation capabilities for scenario analyses, risk assessment and forecasting purposes. It utilizes a panel vector-autoregression to model food insecurity distributions of 15 countries between October 2009 and February 2019. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods are employed to identify the most important agronomic, weather, conflict and economic variables. The paper finds that food insecurity dynamics are asymmetric and past-dependent, with low insecurity states more likely to transition to high insecurity states than vice versa. Conflict variables are more relevant for highly critical states, while agronomic and weather variables are more important for less critical states. Food prices are predictive for all cases. A Bayesian extension is introduced to incorporate expert opinions through the use of priors, which can lead to significant improvements in model performance.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food insecurity; Famine risk; Variable selection; Stochastic simulation; Panel vector-autoregression; Expert opinion\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shenggen Fan, Joanna Brzeska,\\r\\n', b'Chapter 66 Production, Productivity, and Public Investment in East Asian Agriculture,\\r\\n', b'Handbook of Agricultural Economics,\\r\\n', b'Elsevier,\\r\\n', b'Volume 4,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 3401-3434,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1574-0072,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780444518743,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0072(09)04066-3.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040663)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Since the 1950s, agricultural growth in East Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan) has reduced rural poverty and created a strong base for economic development. To gain a better understanding of the nature of this growth, we examine the sources of change in agricultural production and total factor productivity (TFP) and decompose the measurements into reform-based time periods. We also review studies that link public investments to agricultural growth and poverty reduction. We find that formulating growth-inducing and poverty-reducing strategies requires policymakers to understand the relative returns of different types of investments.

Our study tests the relationship between Jim Crow laws and social capital. Methods: We conducted 3-level multilevel hierarchical modeling to study differences in the stock of social capital for 1997, 2005, 2009 in Jim Crow states compared to states without Jim Crow laws. We examined the moderation effects of county level median income, percent Black and percent with high school education and Jim Crow laws on social capital. Results: Jim Crow laws significantly reduced stock of social capital across 1997, 2005, 2009. The model was robust to the inclusion of random county, states, time and fixed county and state level covariates for median income, percent Black and percent with high school education. The largest percent of between state variations explained for fixed variables was from the addition of Jim Crow laws with 2.86%. These results demonstrate that although Jim Crow laws were abolished in 1965, the effects of racial segregation appear to persist through lower social connectiveness, community and trust. A positive moderation effect was seen for median income and percent Black with Jim Crow laws on social capital. Discussion: Our study supports a negative association between Jim Crow laws and reduction in the stock of social capital. This may be attributed to the fracturing of trust, reciprocity and collective action produced by legal racial segregation. Findings from this study offer insight on the potential impacts of historical policies on the social structure of a community. Future research is necessary to further identify the mechanistic pathways and develop interventions to improve social capital.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Social capital; Jim Crow laws; Policy; Segregation; Social determinants of health; Health disparities; Health inequities\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Maggie Thorsen, Ronald McGarvey, Andreas Thorsen,\\r\\n', b'Diabetes management at community health centers: Examining associations with patient and regional characteristics, efficiency, and staffing patterns,\\r\\n', b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n', b'Volume 255,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'113017,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113017.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620302367)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: A major source of primary health care for millions of Americans, community health centers (CHCs) act as a key point of access for diabetes care. The ability of a CHC to deliver high quality care, that supports patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 management of their diabetes, may be impacted by the unique set of resources and constraints it faces, both in terms of characteristics of its patient population and aspects of operations. This study examines how patient and regional characteristics, staffing patterns, and efficiency were associated with diabetes management at CHCs (percentage of patients with uncontrolled diabetes, HbA1C\\xc2\\xa0>\\xc2\\xa09%). Data on a sample of 1229 CHCs came from multiple sources. CHC-level information was obtained from the Uniform Data System and regional-level information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the US Census American Community Survey. A clustering methodology, latent class analysis, identified seven underlying staffing patterns at CHCs. Data envelopment analysis was performed to evaluate the efficiency of CHCs, relative to centers with similar staffing patterns. Finally, generalized linear models were used to examine the association between staffing patterns, efficiency, and patient and regional-level characteristics. Findings from this study have sociological, practical, and methodological implications. Findings highlight that the intersection of patient racial composition with regional racial composition is significant; diabetes control appears to be worse at CHCs serving racial minorities living in predominantly White areas. Findings suggest that CHCs that incorporate more behavioral health care into their staffing mix have lower rates of uncontrolled diabetes among their patients. Finally, greater efficiency in CHC operations is associated with better diabetes control among patients. By identifying sociodemographic and operational characteristics associated with better hemoglobin control among diabetes patients, the current study contributes to our understanding of both health care operations and health inequalities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Diabetes; HbA1C; Community health centers; Staffing; Efficiency\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Lingyun Zhan, Shaojun Wang, Shenxiang Xie, Qingqing Zhang, Yanbo Qu,\\r\\n', b'Spatial path to achieve urban-rural integration development \\xe2\\x88\\x92 analytical framework for coupling the linkage and coordination of urban-rural system functions,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 142,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'102953,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102953.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397523002138)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This study presents a groundbreaking theoretical framework to examine the role of urban-rural system functions (URSFs) in the coordinated development of urban-rural integration (URI). The main emphasis is on the systematic, spatial, and procedural aspects of urban-rural relations (URRs), aiming to rectify the imbalances and deficiencies in URI development. Through multivariate measurement methods, the study evaluates the functional robustness of the urban-rural system (URS) from perspectives of living, production, and ecology, and distinguishes the degree of interaction and coordination. It introduces a spatial path for URI using module combinations and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint-axis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d abstract logic. An empirical analysis of China's eastern provinces discloses a noticeable decrease in URS functionality from developed to underdeveloped regions. Although linkage and complementarity between urban and rural areas are significant, mutual promotion and equilibrium between urban and rural production and living functions remain suboptimal. In Shandong Province, the coordination attributes of the three primary URSFs are predominantly characterized by low coordination, an imbalance type of weaker R, and significant urban overshadowing of rural dynamics. Urban-rural synchronous promotion overwhelmingly defines URS functional relationship typologies. The integrated pattern of urban-rural development (URD) after the integration of system functions is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint-area\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature, gradually expanding the scope from the URI model area, the URI pilot area, and the URI transition area to the URI key area, and shows the spatial structural layout of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo centers, three groups and six circles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. To achieve URI development, comprehensive planning and coordinated promotion of new urbanization and rural revitalization strategies are needed, focusing on micro-level rural regional system issues. The study emphasizes a new model and path for URI development, wherein urban areas support rural development, both develop synchronously, and rural development takes precedence over urban development.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban-rural integration development; Urban-rural system function; Linkage; Harmony; Spatial path; Shandong province\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Daniel L.

In an attempt to bring clarity to this conversation, our research presents an urban green gentrification framework, based on findings from a scoping review and dimensional analysis conducted across green gentrification, urban greening, and related literatures. Our study is guided by two primary objectives: (1) identify the key dimensions of green gentrification as it pertains to urban greening; and (2) explore the relationships and intersections between dimensions in terms of their implications for the social impacts and outcomes of urban greening initiatives. We identify three principle dimensions of green gentrification as it relates to urban greening \\xe2\\x80\\x94 conceptual foundations; design and intent; and socio-spatial change \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as six related sub-dimensions. Considered in tandem, these dimensions present green gentrification as a dynamic process bound within a history of exploitative, neoliberal social and economic processes, operating beyond the scope of any single urban greening initiative. Responding to green gentrification, therefore, requires trans-dimensional strategies that consider these structural influences guiding patterns of urban greening investment and development. Our results also show that green gentrification is not a sufficient explanation for the complexities of urban development and change, and greening should be considered alongside other drivers of gentrification more broadly.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Green gentrification; Urban greening; Nature-based solutions; Environmental justice\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Khalid Zaman, Muhammad Mushtaq Khan, Mehboob Ahmad,\\r\\n', b'RETRACTED: The relationship between foreign direct investment and pro-poor growth policies in Pakistan: The new interface,\\r\\n', b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n', b'Volume 29, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1220-1227,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.04.020.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312001137)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

From the perspective of anti-poverty, this paper examines the impact of formal credit constraints (FCCs) and informal credit constraints (IFCCs) on economic vulnerability (EV) using the data from the China Household Income Project (CHIP) survey for 2013 (CHIPs 2013) of rural households. The potential endogeneity problem of credit constraints (CCs) is addressed by applying the control function approach within an ordered probit model. The results show that both FCCs and IFCCs have a robust positive and significant impact on the EV of rural households and that the impact of FCCs is greater than that of IFCCs. To identify the potential mechanisms through which CCs affect EV, the seemingly unrelated regressions are used and the potential intercorrelation among these mechanisms is examined. We find that the impact of CCs on EV is partly mediated by health, trust, per capita financial assets and per capita income, whereby health and per capita income contribute to most of the total indirect effect. Thus, policies focus on supply-side and demand-side to improve credit accessibility could reduce rural households' EV, especially through its positive effect on health and per capita income.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: credit constraints; economic vulnerability; causal mediation mechanisms; rural China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Divyani Kohli, Alfred Stein, Richard Sliuzas,\\r\\n', b'Uncertainty analysis for image interpretations of urban slums,\\r\\n', b'Computers, Environment and Urban Systems,\\r\\n', b'Volume 60,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 37-49,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0198-9715,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.07.010.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516301533)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Image interpretations are used to identify slums in object-oriented image analysis (OOA). Such interpretations, however, contain uncertainties which may negatively impact the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we study the spatial uncertainties related to the delineations of slums as observed from very high resolution (VHR) images in the contexts of Ahmedabad (India), Nairobi (Kenya) and Cape Town (South Africa). Nineteen image interpretations and supplementary data were acquired for each context by means of semi-structured questionnaires. Slum areas agreed upon by different experts were determined. Uncertainty was modelled using random sets, and boundary variation was quantified using the bootstrapping method. Results show a highly significant difference between slum identification and delineation for the three contexts, whereas the level of experience in slum-related studies of experts is not significant. Factors of the built environment used by experts to distinguish slums from non-slum areas or leading to deviations in slum identification are discussed. We conclude that uncertainties in slum delineations from VHR images can be quantified successfully using modern spatial statistical methods.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Existential uncertainty; Extensional uncertainty; Informal settlements; Remote sensing; Random sets; Object-oriented image analysis (OOA)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David Cuberes, Jennifer Roberts, Cristina Sechel,\\r\\n', b'Household location in English cities,\\r\\n', b'Regional Science and Urban Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 75,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 120-135,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0166-0462,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2019.01.012.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046218301054)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper is the first to test an amenity-based sorting model for cities in England. We explore household location under both monocentric and polycentric assumptions about city structure. On average, we find no systematic relationship between income and household distance to the city centre. However, there are differences between cities, with a positive income-distance relationship in Birmingham and Leeds, and a negative relationship in Newcastle. Household heterogeneity is also important; for example, on average households with heads who are migrants live 25% closer to the centre than non-migrants. We also find that only the employed (and those above the poverty line) are influenced by the availability of public transport, which is in direct opposition to the US evidence.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Cities; Household location; Income; Amenities\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kristof De Witte, Sofie Cabus, Geert Thyssen, Wim Groot, Henri\\xc3\\xabtte Maassen van den Brink,\\r\\n', b'A critical review of the literature on school dropout,\\r\\n', b'Educational Research Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 10,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 13-28,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1747-938X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2013.05.002.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X13000286)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper reviews the growing literature on early school leaving.

Applying a multilevel model on a large dataset of about 90,000 households, we find that the share of households at risk of becoming food-insecure (vulnerability) is higher than the share that is current food-insecure. Households in rural areas are least vulnerable. In contrast, residents of cities and urban areas experience high level of vulnerability that exceeds the average in the Punjab. The risk-induced vulnerability is higher than the structural-induced vulnerability and vulnerability to idiosyncratic shock is higher than vulnerability to covariate shocks. Findings imply that households in the Punjab are vulnerable not as a result of poor resource endowments but because of risk. The Pakistani government should go beyond mere observed food-insecurity to address the needs of the relatively larger population that is at risk of being food-insecure in the future.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food-insecurity; Vulnerability; Shocks; Multilevel model; Punjab; Pakistan\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mazifah Simis, Azahan Awang, Kadir Arifin,\\r\\n', b\"From Ex-landfill to Public Park: Impact on Local Community's Quality of Life and Living Environment,\\r\\n\", b'Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 222,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 763-771,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1877-0428,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.05.157.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042816302312)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Regarded as a new development urban planning approach in developing countries, brownfield regeneration, particularly the redevelopment of ex-landfills as public parks in Malaysia, leads to the question of this research: could such development benefit the local communities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quality of life and living environment?

Against this background, we investigate the role of higher education for urban growth in China. A panel data analysis reveals that an increase of share in the population with at least a bachelor's degree induces regional population to grow. Nevertheless, contrary to other developed countries, inflow of high caliber immigrants from the countryside or cities of lower tiers in China in fact brings down real wages. We hypothesize that in China where education resources are limited, higher education attainment induces faster urban growth through breaking the barriers to rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban transition for new job market entrants, but at the cost of lower real wages due to affluent labor supply. However, the increase of population share with high education has insignificant direct impact on housing price, indicating that new talented migrants may not be the major home buyers. Yet, through the trigger of a faster urbanization process, housing prices are jetted up indirectly in provinces with higher proportions of degree holders. It poses pressing challenges to China where the country is advocating the idea of inclusive urbanization. This paper will discuss some of the key issues in relation to the provisions of education and housing services in China such that local governments can be more embracing to rural degree holder migrants, who will play a contributing role in urban growth.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Higher education; Employment; Housing price; Real wage; Urban growth\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rita Schneider-Sliwa,\\r\\n', b'Urban Geography,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

Over the past decade, societies have witnessed changes that were unprecedented in recent history: the collapse of political and economic systems, new integration policies, globalization of the economy and the decline of the nation-state, mass migration, governmental retrenchment, and social restructuring. Structural changes in societies manifest themselves distinctly in urban areas and every generation needs to engage in the discourse on a country's built politics, the sustainability of urban form and design, and the ecological footprint of major cities and suburban areas. Urban geography deals with the analysis of the complex dimensions of urban social, economic, cultural, and political processes, patterns, and structures and urban planning processes to build up or retain local comparative advantages, while retaining cities as livable urban places and securing their sound social and environmental development for future generations. This article describes the conceptual and methodological approaches and the long-term prospects of urban geography.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban development; Urban geography; Urban research; Urban social geography; Urban studies\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Nik Ahmad Sufian Burhan, Yohan Kurniawan, Abdul Halim Sidek, Mohd Rosli Mohamad,\\r\\n', b'Crimes and the Bell curve: The role of people with high, average, and low intelligence,\\r\\n', b'Intelligence,\\r\\n', b'Volume 47,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 12-22,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0160-2896,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.08.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001238)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The present study examines whether crime rates can be reduced by increasing the IQ of people with high, average, and low IQ. Previous studies have shown that as a determinant of the national level of income per capita growth and technological achievement, the IQ of the intellectual class (those at the 95th percentile of the Bell curve distribution of population intelligence) is more important than the IQ of those with average ability at the 50th percentile. Extending these findings, our study incorporates the non-intellectual class (IQ at the 5th percentile) to examine the role of IQ classes in determining crime rates across countries. We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses with IQ, seven types of crimes, and nine control variables: urbanization, alcohol consumption, unemployment rate, young to old population ratio, income inequality, education attainment, drug consumption, police rate, and income per capita. Regardless of types of crimes, we found evidence that raising IQ will lessen crime rates, with raises in the 95th percentile group having the most number of significant impacts, followed by the 50th and then the 5th percentile groups. Furthermore, none of the nine control factors was stronger than the 95th percentile group in predicting crime rates. We conclude that the intellectual class influences rates of more types of crime than the non-intellectual class does. The intellectual class has the highest authority in determining law enforcement and development policies. Therefore, increasing the IQ of politicians and leaders from this class than other social classes will have a more significant influence in reducing crime rates, through enhanced functionality and quality of institutions across countries.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Bell curve; Crimes; Intellectual class; National IQ; Non-intellectual class\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n', b'8 - The consequences of the obesity epidemic on food production: empirical evidence from Latin American and Caribbean countries,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n', b'Obesity Epidemic and the Environment,\\r\\n', b'Academic Press,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'Pages 219-240,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780323993395,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-99339-5.00010-8.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323993395000108)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This chapter investigates the impact of the obesity epidemic on food production. Obesity is a public health problem, and a range of different factors cause it. On the other hand, the high prevalence of obesity creates economic effects. Therefore, this chapter approached the topic of whether the obesity problem contributes to an increase in food production. The data from 16 LAC countries from 1991 to 2016 and the ordinary least squares (OLS) model approach were used to carry out this investigation. The main result of this estimation confirms the positive correlation between food production and obesity. This result is supported by the social and economic processes of urbanisation and globalisation brought by economic growth, which increases production, including food production, and increases the prevalence of obesity.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food production; Income; Latin America and the Caribbean; Obesity; OLS model; Poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Santha Vaithilingam, Mahendhiran Nair, Mary Macharia, Viswanath Venkatesh,\\r\\n', b'Mobile communication and use behavior of the urban poor in a developing country: A field study in Malaysia,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Information Management,\\r\\n', b'Volume 63,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'102440,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0268-4012,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102440.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026840122100133X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: We developed a contextualized model to predict the use of technology among the urban poor.

Such assessments may be imprecise as they do not reflect the impact of people's daily mobility patterns. Furthermore, most studies have focused on urban areas in developed countries, whilst relatively little is known about the situation in developing nations, particularly a tropical climate region where heat exposure is severe for residents. As a case study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we conducted a heat exposure assessment by integrating individual mobility data which was obtained from a questionnaire survey. Estimates of heat exposure were made using remotely sensed land surface temperature data. Population exposures based on residential locations were compared to a dynamic exposure model that incorporated mobility. Especially for people in suburban areas, we found the traditional assessment method based on the static residential model underestimated exposure compared to the dynamic model owing to the fact that some residents migrate into the city center each day where they tend to experience higher temperatures. We found small differences in heat exposure levels between social groups stratified by gender, age, and income based on the dynamic and static models. These results demonstrate that integration of mobility patterns may be important when comparing exposure levels between urban and suburban populations. Our findings may raise issues regarding new remediation measures against urban heat islands, such as reviewing the distribution of health resources or generating a risk map.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Population mobility; Heat exposure assessment; Geographic information systems; Remote sensing; Bangladesh\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Uttam Paudel, Krishna Prasad Pant,\\r\\n', b'Understanding vitality of public space: A review with an example of capital city Kathmandu in Nepal,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 133,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'106860,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106860.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837723003265)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: By definition, public spaces are areas or locations that are open and accessible to all people, and in cities they are open space that is specifically concerned with public health, social cohesion, and the quality of urban life. This paper reports a review of literatures on urban public spaces attempting to gauge the research gaps on public spaces through a scoping-review analysis of relevant studies. The review of relevant literatures published from 1990 to 2023 led to an inference that there is a huge gap in defining the publicness (non-excludable and non-rival) of the public spaces in Nepal. Furthermore, knowledge about public spaces is found to be scattered. However, all Nepal-based research identified that open spaces in Kathmandu valley were severely encroached upon. Rapid urbanization, along with a lack of resilient urban planning and governance, appears to have a significant influence on urban public spaces and social cohesion, as well as diseconomies in emerging economies. Social inequalities, health disparities, environmental injustice, economic instability and stifled cultural expression are all intricately bound to urban public spaces, particularly green public space, which still remains a research priority for new evidence-based urban policymakers and urban planners in developing countries. Future research should therefore focus on a multilevel approach preferably using network model to cover and comprehend the societal-benefits of public space, extending large-scale quantitative assessments with field evaluations of each public space, community surveys, and other qualitative research in Nepal. Component-wise research gaps are also evidently explored in the course of separate domains.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban public space; Green space; Social cohesion; Healthy lifestyle; Economic stability\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Daina Romeo, Eldbj\\xc3\\xb8rg Blikra Vea, Marianne Thomsen,\\r\\n', b'Environmental Impacts of Urban Hydroponics in Europe: A Case Study in Lyon,\\r\\n', b'Procedia CIRP,\\r\\n', b'Volume 69,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 540-545,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2212-8271,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2017.11.048.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221282711730820X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The food provisioning of European cities depends on the global food supply system. However, both economic crises, environmental pressure and climate change effects represent a risk for food chain stability. Urban agriculture (UA) increases the self-sufficiency and resiliency of cities and is able to deliver positive environmental and social benefits. However, its efficacy depends on several variables, including the type of UA and the geographical location of the city. This paper analyses ReFarmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pilot farm, a vertical high-yield hydroponic croft located in the urban area of Lyon, France, from a life cycle perspective. The results show that the hydroponic farm performs better than cultivations in heated greenhouses, and similarly to conventional open field farms. Moreover, the source of the electricity input is a determinant factor that, if carbon neutral (e.g. wind energy) allows vertical hydroponic production to outperform the two conventional types of agriculture.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Life Cycle Assessment; Urban agriculture; Hydroponics\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Maria Sagrario Floro, Ranjula Bali Swain,\\r\\n', b'Food Security, Gender, and Occupational Choice among Urban Low-Income Households,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 42,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 89-99,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.08.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12002185)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'This paper examines an adaptive strategy using occupational choice that can be undertaken by household members in urban poor areas to help ensure their access to food.

As urbanization continues, this presents serious problems for biodiversity and the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 7. Understanding the persistent demand for charcoal, especially among urban households with access to electricity, is a critical step towards ensuring sustainable forest management while encouraging households to transition to cleaner sources of energy. Herein, we profile urban charcoal users living in the heart of southern Africa's miombo woodlands. We use an ordinary least squares regression model to predict charcoal consumption among a sample of households in Tete, Mozambique with widespread connectivity to the electrical grid. Our findings indicate that income plays only a negligible role in predicting monthly per capita charcoal consumption. More important are personal preferences and the peer effects of friendships with non-charcoal using peers. These findings present possible pathways for policy-makers to induce a shift in charcoal demand among urban households and to promote switching to cleaner cooking fuels.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Charcoal; Peer effects; Multiple fuels model; Clean energy; SDG-7; Mozambique\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Asma Mohsin, Khalid Zaman,\\r\\n', b'RETRACTED: Distributional effects of rising food prices in Pakistan: Evidence from HIES 2001\\xe2\\x80\\x9302 and 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9306 survey,\\r\\n', b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n', b'Volume 29, Issue 5,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1986-1995,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.06.002.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312001757)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

It first provides a historical account of the relations between mining activities and emergence of towns. Second, the legal environment informing the development or otherwise of mining towns is presented. Third, implications of mining induced towns on Ghana's urban planning are discussed. Using documentary review and empirical cases of selected mining towns, findings indicate that the political economic situation of Ghana's mining industry has produced and continues to shape affected intermediate towns in five ways: 1) some mining towns are experiencing relative growth, while others are slowly dying; 2) death or complete collapse of mining communities after mining boom 3) changed functions and local economy after mine operations are closed down; 4) emergence of new mining settlements resulting from new investments; and 5) resettlement communities resulting from displacement from the harmful effects of mine operations. These factors have implications for urban planning, and this paper proposes three entry points with implications for other developing countries: a space in Ghana's urban development policy for mining towns; a re-look at the content and focus of corporate social responsibilities of mining firms; and a functional link between growth of mining and urban planning.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Human settlements; Urban planning; Mining towns; Political economy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kirti Gaur, Kunal Keshri, William Joe,\\r\\n', b\"Does living in slums or non-slums influence women's nutritional status?

The analysis is based on the National Family Health Survey (2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9306) of India and highlights the dual burden of malnutrition among urban women. The results show that one in every two women in mega-cities is malnourished (either undernourished or overnourished), but a biased, analytical focus on citywide averages conceals the nature of the problem. Overnutrition among women is notably higher in non-slum areas whereas underweight persists as a key concern among slum dwellers. Cities located in the Central India (Nagpur and Indore) have the highest proportion of underweight women whereas the cities in South India (Chennai and Hyderabad) show a high prevalence of overweight women across both slum and non-slum areas. The intensity of income-related inequalities in underweight outcome is much greater for non-slum areas, whereas inequalities in overweight outcomes are higher among slums. Furthermore, regression analysis indicates that place of residence as such has no significant impact on women's nutritional status and that this elementary association is primarily a ramification mediated through other key socioeconomic correlates. Results suggest that, it would be rational to develop a comprehensive urban nutritional plan that focuses on dietary planning and behaviour change to address both type of malnutrition at the same time.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: India; Undernutrition; Overnutrition; Malnutrition duality; Income-inequality; Women; Slum and non-slum\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gary S.

These challenges generally faced by less developing countries, while Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries has no exemption to escape out from this food-water-energy poverty nexus due to inadequate socio-economic and environmental action programs of sustainable development. This study examined the dynamic nexus between agricultural sustainability and food-energy-water poverty in a panel of selected SSA countries over the period of 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x932013. The study used pooled least squares regression, pooled fixed effects, and pooled random effects regression techniques to absorb country-specific-time-variant shocks. The Hausman (1978) test results reveal that country-specific shocks influence the food-energy-water poverty model; therefore, the fixed effects regression results are consider a better fit model than that of the pooled random effect model. The overall results conclude that agricultural value added, cereal yields and forest area significantly decreases food-energy-water poverty nexus, leading to higher economic growth and price levels at the cost of environmental degradation. In general, agricultural sustainability is the prerequisite for reducing food-energy-water poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Agricultural sustainability; Food poverty; Energy poverty; Water poverty; Sub-Saharan African countries\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ramit Debnath, Ronita Bardhan, Minna Sunikka-Blank,\\r\\n', b'Discomfort and distress in slum rehabilitation: Investigating a rebound phenomenon using a backcasting approach,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 87,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 75-90,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.03.010.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397519300839)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Slum rehabilitation policies in India is observed to have a rebound effect on the occupants, where rehabilitated occupants move back to the horizontal slums. In this study, we investigate the cause behind this rebound phenomenon based on a theory of homeostasis, where the loss of homeostasis refers to occupants' heightened discomfort and distress in their built environment. A novel methodological framework was developed to investigate it based on the principles of participatory backcasting approach and the theory of homeostasis. Thirty households in Mumbai's slum rehabilitation housing were interviewed to determine the social, economic and environmental cause of distress and discomfort. Granular information was obtained by further investigating the factors that influence occupants' attitude, emotions, health, control and habits in their built environment that regulates their holistic comfort and lack of stress. The causal linkages among these factors were established using a qualitative fault tree. Results show two primary cause of distress and discomfort in the study area owing to economic distress and built environment related discomfort. Economic distress was from low-income and high electricity bills due to higher household appliance ownership, and built environment discomfort was due to lack of social spaces and poor design of the slum rehabilitation housing. This study showed that mitigating such non-income drivers of distress and discomfort can prevent rebound phenomenon and improve the sustainability of the slum rehabilitation process.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Slum rehabilitation; Sustainability; Homeostasis; Discomfort; Distress; Urban; Poverty; Energy; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Andrew P.

However, progressive land abandonment in these areas questions the rationale and targeting of support payments to maintain viable farming enterprises. Using micro level data on farm businesses over the period 2003-2016 matched to land capability and spatial data we identify the distribution of viable and vulnerable enterprises in Less Favoured Areas. We find five categories of household based on progressive quality of life thresholds, namely i. vulnerable, ii. sustainable, iii. viable, iv. resilient, and v. robust. A proportional odds model measured the effect of biophysical and remote disadvantage on predicting these states of viability, along with farm family lifecycle factors. Whilst we would expect higher proportions of disadvantaged farmland to be negatively related to viability, when combined with rural remoteness this increases the magnitude of the effect. However, clear succession planning and tenancy arrangements suggest that approaches to management of the business and the farm family life-cycle may overcome some of these disadvantages. These results have to be considered against the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s planned withdrawal from the Common Agricultural Policy. This offers opportunities to provide a more nuanced approach to targeting and supporting disadvantaged regions beyond current criteria. However, there would seem to be dissonance between the proposed payment for public goods agenda, which is results orientated, and support for correcting natural disadvantages where opportunities for delivery of these public goods will be limited.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Less favoured areas; Proportional odds model; Payment for public goods; Brexit\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Susan Parnell,\\r\\n', b'Defining a Global Urban Development Agenda,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 78,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 529-540,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.028.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15002508)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'The United Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent endorsement of a stand-alone urban Sustainable Development Goal and the immanent formulation of Habitat III marks a watershed in global development discourse on cities. The New Urban Agenda, currently under debate, is located in its historical context to reveal who the major actors and institutions were that defined global urban policy; what the shifting normative positions on cities are; and why the increasingly complex process of the global policy environment makes defining a universal agreement on urban development so hard. At stake in UN negotiations are fundamental issues about the centrality of urban pathways to sustainable development. A historical view of the Habitat process reveals that even at the global scale it is possible for those with strong convictions to change the normative base and mode of working on urban issues, but that the compromise politics of the international system also masks important compromises and contradictions. Looking back over the decades of international debate on development priorities shows not only that there is now greater acceptance of the importance of defining and agreeing to \\xe2\\x80\\x9can urban agenda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that global policy on urban and regional issues has indeed evolved.

Using the unconditional quantile regression decomposition, we find that the majority of the observed gap in each year is explained by the urban advantage in endowments.

A decomposition of the change in the gap over 1983\\xe2\\x80\\x932011 suggests that increasing gap between urban and rural areas in the share of tertiary educated population accounts for a significant part of the observed increase in the gap.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban-rural welfare gap; Unconditional quantile regression; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Chen Yang, Zhu Qian, Huan Li,\\r\\n', b'Measuring the accessibility deprivation of concentrated resettlement communities in China: An integrated approach of space syntax and multi-criteria decision analysis,\\r\\n', b'Applied Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 150,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'102839,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0143-6228,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102839.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622822002107)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: China's rapid urbanization involves the large-scale relocation of rural villagers and the production of concentrated resettlement communities in urban areas. This new urban population's post-resettlement adaptation and socio-economic situations raise concerns for urban scholars and policymakers alike. This paper invokes the concept of deprivation and aims to establish indices of multiple deprivations (IMDs) for such communities. In doing so, this research use accessibility as a proxy and integrates the space syntax approach with multi-criteria decision analysis to construct the IMDs of concentrated resettlement communities in Hangzhou, China. The findings suggest that material deprivation may not be the primary concern for residential segregation of resettlement communities in urban areas. Besides, the accessibility to different services reflects diverse deprivation patterns among resettlement communities. Moreover, various stakeholder groups' perceptions of deprivation may lead to different results of the IMDs. The diverse criteria or domains of deprivation contribute differently to the deprivation, which requires a tailored treatment strategy when constructing IMDs, such as the sensitivity analysis used in this research. The proposed measurement of deprivation has important policy implications for sustainable urban development in China.\\r\\n\", b'\\n', b'Hernan Galperin, Raul Katz, Ramiro Valencia,\\r\\n', b'The impact of broadband on poverty reduction in rural Ecuador,\\r\\n', b'Telematics and Informatics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 75,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'101905,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0736-5853,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101905.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001381)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This study examines the impact of broadband deployment on labor income and employment (in both level and composition) in rural Ecuador. The analysis spans the 2011 to 2019 period, during which the share of rural households covered by high-speed broadband increased from 14.5% to 83%. The empirical strategy exploits variations in the timing of network deployment, as well as the fact that several rural areas remained unserved by 2019. To estimate impact, the study uses a semi-parametric alternative to the standard two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant\\xe2\\x80\\x99Anna (2021). Overall, the findings indicate that broadband deployment in rural areas is associated with measurable gains in labor income and employment. Our income model estimates range from an increase of 14% to 21% above the expected level had broadband not been deployed in these areas. The impact estimates on employment are more modest, ranging from 3% to 5% (depending on the specification) above the mean employment level over the study period. Additionally, our results corroborate that ICTs help diversify employment opportunities, as the share of agricultural employment falls in the connected areas. The findings also suggest that the economic benefits associated with broadband favor younger workers, presumably because their skills better match the newly created jobs.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Broadband Impact; Rural Development; Latin America; Difference-in-Difference\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xia Wang, Shaoqi Hai, Peiru Cai,\\r\\n', b'Urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural disparity of child poverty in China: Spatio-temporal changes and influencing factors,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Rural Studies,\\r\\n', b'Volume 91,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'Pages 170-183,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0743-0167,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.03.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016722000444)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Abstract\\r\\n', b'Eradicating child poverty and shrinking urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural disparity are the common goals of humanity.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the likely increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions from rising incomes among the world's poor. We examine drivers of and predict appliance ownership using machine learning and other techniques with household survey data in India, South Africa and Brazil. Televisions and refrigerators are consistently preferred over washing machines. Income is still the predominant driver of aggregate penetration levels, but its influence differs by appliance and by region. The affordability of appliances, wealth, race and religion together, among other household characteristics, help explain the heterogeneity in appliance ownership at lower income levels. Understanding non-income drivers can be helpful to identify barriers to appliance uptake and to better forecast near term residential energy demand growth within countries.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Household behavior; Residential energy; Appliance diffusion\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Nijika Shrivastwa, Brenda W.

Using original survey data from rural India, we show that seasonal migrants prefer to earn 35 percent less on local public works rather than incur the cost of migrating. Structural estimates suggest that the fixed cost of migration is small, and can be entirely explained by travel costs and income risk. In contrast, the flow cost of migration is high. We argue that higher living costs in the city explain only a small part of the flow cost of migration and that most of it is non-monetary.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Internal migration; Workfare programs; India; Urban; Rural\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Raheela Saad,\\r\\n', b'Women and DRR in urban slums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building resilience through development,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n', b'Volume 60,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'102264,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102264.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420921002302)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Rapid, unplanned growth of urban areas in South Asia and an increase in absolute poverty have led to the phenomenon of \\xe2\\x80\\x9curbanisation of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, resulting in a massive increase in slums across all major cities in countries like Pakistan. This has compounded the vulnerability and exposure ofresidents in these slums to disasters, especially as an outcome of exposure to hazards. Amongst the most vulnerable are women, typically lying near the bottom of not just the poverty or wealth index, but in nearly every index of human development, giving rise to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeminisation of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. An increased frequency of disasters, coupled with multidimensional vulnerabilities, high probability of exposure and compromised capacities places the women highest in the risk profile for disasters also. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) has shifted focus from disaster management to disaster risk management (DRM) by setting goals for both, preventing new and reducing existing disaster risks, by strengthening community resilience through socio-economic and other development measures. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to leave no one behind in enhancing capacities of individuals and communities through development. In this context, understanding the vulnerabilities and associated risks for women, especially those who are in urban slums which have so far been treated by policy makers as an amorphous mass within the greater urban world, becomes critical. Gender vulnerability in a disaster-risk context directly links to pre-existing vulnerabilities within the society as being outcomes of skewed development processes, poverty, construed status of women and rapid urbanisation. In order to empower these women effectively, it is critical to understand the pre-existing vulnerabilities, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvulnerability bundles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and address them by focusing on reducing the risks they generate with reference to the four priority areas of the SFDRR. An analysis using five dimensions of vulnerability that has been recognised through research over the years, substantiates that women in urban slums are more susceptible to being affected by disasters as an outcome of the daily challenges that they face. Some of these challenges include patriarchal society, sociocultural and religious beliefs, gender stereotyping, insecure livelihoods, non-availability of services such as WASH, health and education, sexual abuse and violence, and a lack of legal identity. Disaster risk reduction measures for women living in slums should aim to minimise risks for them, while enhancing their resilience by reducing vulnerabilities and increasing capacities, by working through the socioeconomic systems within their circumstances. Therefore, emphasis has to be on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-skewing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d development by making it risk-based, inclusive and comprehensive towards reducing vulnerabilities of the women in urban slums. There should also be efforts towards enhancing their coping capacities, which, like vulnerability, needs management through the development portfolio. Increasing resilience can be incremental through radical policies and targeted development through the portfolio of SDGs, leading to greater investment in slums through public works.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban slums; Gender vulnerability; SFDRR; SDGs DRM\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Melody Esther Tulier, Carolina Reid, Mahasin S.

Increased attention on urban health inequities have propelled research on the relationship between gentrification and health. Yet, there are significant challenges inherent in the study of gentrification given its non-linear process occurring at multiple levels and via various mechanisms in a complex web of urban systems. How then have empirical studies addressed questions regarding the relationship between gentrification and health and wellness from a conceptual and methodological standpoint? Applying key search terms to PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 546 papers published in the United States. This review is guided by three foundational premises informing the inclusion and exclusion of articles. These include: 1. a clear definition of gentrification and explicit health outcome; 2. identification of a specific geographic context (United States) in which gentrification occurs, and 3. use of a social determinants of health framework to identify potential health outcomes of interest. 17 papers met our inclusion criteria. Through systematic content analysis using MaxQDA software, we evaluated the included studies using three critical frames: 1. conceptualization of gentrification; 2. mechanisms linking gentrification and health; and 3. spatio-temporal considerations. Based on this analysis, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing research, and offer three methodological approaches to strengthen the current literature on gentrification and health. We recommend that future studies: 1. explicitly identify the mechanisms and levels at which processes can occur and systems are organized; 2. incorporate space and time into the analytical strategy and 3. articulate an epistemological standpoint driven by their conceptualization of the exposure and identification of the relevant mechanism and outcome of interest.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shariska Petersen, Parmida Shahiri, Andrea Jewell, Lori Spoozak, Julia Chapman, Sharon Fitzgerald-Wolff, Sue Min Lai, Dineo Khabele,\\r\\n', b'Disparities in ovarian cancer survival at the only NCI-designated cancer center in Kansas,\\r\\n', b'The American Journal of Surgery,\\r\\n', b'Volume 221, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'Pages 712-717,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0002-9610,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.12.009.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000296102030787X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Background\\r\\n', b'This study examined the impact of geographic distance on survival outcomes for patients receiving treatment for ovarian cancer at the only NCI-designated cancer center (NCI-CC) in Kansas.\\r\\n', b'Methods\\r\\n', b'We identified ovarian cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Cancer Center between 2010 and 2015.

Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVI-derived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a comprehensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Sustainable Development Goal; Street view image; Environment monitoring; Greenness; Systematic review; Green space; Health geography; Spatial epidemiology\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Umut Do\\xc4\\x9fan, Merve Ko\\xc3\\xa7ak G\\xc3\\xbcng\\xc3\\xb6r, B\\xc3\\xbclent Bostanc\\xc4\\xb1, Ne\\xc5\\x9fe Y\\xc4\\xb1lmaz Bak\\xc4\\xb1r,\\r\\n', b'GIS Based Urban Renewal Area Awareness and Expectation Analysis Using Fuzzy Modeling,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 54,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'101945,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101945.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670719309552)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: It is necessary to establish a new urban renewal approach, prioritizing the participation of the local society with the capability to resolve problems with the contributions of government, private sectors, and society.

Because of the lack of modelling regarding the spatial references in these questionnaire-based studies, no significant contributions can be made in the decision-making processes of planning that drive sustainable urban transformation.

There have been numerous studies explaining how economic growth can affect various dimensions of human development. Further, additional arguments have been generated to indicate that tourism may also be the vehicle with which to impact human development and economic growth. However, the literature on the nexus between human development, economic growth, and tourism is riddled with mixed results. The results from this study suggest the presence of three unique long-run relationships. First, tourism does not promote human development. Instead, it is the degree and measure of human development that promotes tourism by creating a lopsided relationship. Second, a virtuous cycle between human development and economic growth exists. Third, the study found a unidirectional causality supporting the economics-driven tourism growth, meaning that tourism growth is a product of economic growth but not vice versa. The study concludes with implications for tourism development in the case of Ecuador.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Quality of life; Co-integration; Error correction; Granger causality; Tourism arrivals; Human development; Economic growth; Ecuador\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sanatan Nayak, Surendra Singh Jatav,\\r\\n', b'Are livelihoods of slum dwellers sustainable and secure in developing economies?

Urban informal settlements, usually defined by certain criteria such as self-build housing, sub-standard services, and residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 low incomes, are often seen as problematic, due to associations with poverty, irregularity and marginalisation. In particular, despite years of research and policy, gaps in urban theory and limited understandings of urban informal settlements mean that they are often treated as outside \\xe2\\x80\\x98normal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 urban considerations, with material effects for residents including discrimination, eviction and displacement. In response to these considerations, this article uses a place-making approach to explore the spatial, social and cultural construction of place in this context, in order to unsettle some of the assumptions underlying discursive constructions of informal settlements, and how these relate to spatial and social marginalisation. Research was carried out using a qualitative, ethnographic methodology in two case study neighbourhoods in Xalapa, Mexico. Mexico offers fertile ground to explore these issues. Despite an extensive land tenure regularisation programme, at least 60 per cent of urban dwellers live in colonias populares, neighbourhoods with informal characteristics. The research found that local discourses reveal complex and ambivalent views of colonias populares, which both reproduce and undermine marginalising tendencies relating to \\xe2\\x80\\x98informality\\xe2\\x80\\x99. A focus on residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own place-making activities hints at prospects for rethinking urban informal settlements. By capturing the messy, dynamic and contextualised processes that construct urban informal settlements as places, the analytical lens of place-making offers a view of the multiple influences which frame them. Informed by perspectives from critical social geography which seek to capture the \\xe2\\x80\\x98ordinary\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nature of cities, this article suggests imagining urban informal settlements differently, in order to re-evaluate their potential contribution to the city as a whole.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban informal settlements; Place-making; Marginalisation; Place identity; Mexico\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ntobeko Mchunu, Gareth Lagerwall, Aidan Senzanje,\\r\\n', b'Aquaponics in South Africa: Results of a national survey,\\r\\n', b'Aquaculture Reports,\\r\\n', b'Volume 12,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 12-19,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2352-5134,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2018.08.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352513418300383)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Aquaponic system is a productive, innovative and sustainable fish and vegetable production system that could contribute to the needed innovation in agriculture in the face of drought, soil pollution and climate change. Aquaponics are still an emerging practice worldwide, but particularly in South Africa. This study was conducted in 2016 using an online survey questionnaire to collect information about the types of systems used, the management and distribution of aquaponics in South Africa. A total of 44 responses were captured within three months. The most commonly raised fish was tilapia (82%). The most commonly raised plants were leafy vegetables (75%). Since aquaponics is still not practiced by many and aquaponics systems are mostly small, aquaponics in South Africa can be considered an emerging practice. Most of the current aquaponics practitioners have limited aquaponics production knowledge. We therefore conclude that attention should be paid to raising the awareness about the potential of aquaponics, and raising the technological knowledge of aquaponics operators to increase the number of aquaponics operations and to increase the total amount of food produced in and with aquaponics.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Aquaponics; Leafy vegetables; Tilapia; Small systems\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Zhilin Zeng, Juan Zhan, Liyuan Chen, Huilong Chen, Sheng Cheng,\\r\\n', b'Global, regional, and national dengue burden from 1990 to 2017: A systematic analysis based on the global burden of disease study 2017,\\r\\n', b'EClinicalMedicine,\\r\\n', b'Volume 32,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'100712,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2589-5370,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100712.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020304569)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Background\\r\\n', b'Dengue is one of the most common vector-borne diseases globally, however, its burden is poorly quantified.

In addition, the number of deaths due to dengue increased from approximately16 957 (7 613\\xe2\\x80\\x9330 091) in 1990 to 40 467 (17 620\\xe2\\x80\\x9349 778) in 2017.

Overall, there were 2 922 630 DALYs (1 629 424\\xe2\\x80\\x933 967 492) attributed to dengue in 2017 globally, an increase of 107.6% since 1990 (1 407 571 DALYs [624 016.4\\xe2\\x80\\x932 510 025]), and the age-standardised DALY rate increased from 26.10 (11.57\\xe2\\x80\\x9346.53) per 100 000 population to 38.25 (21.33\\xe2\\x80\\x9351.93) per 100 000 population between 1990 and 2017. The association between socio-demographic index (SDI) and dengue-related DALYs suggested that the lowest age-standardised DALY rates were found in countries in the low and high-SDI quintile in 2017, and from 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized DALY rate tended to increase in regions with the lowest SDI but declined in regions with the highest SDI.

However, the existence and extent of gendered household food security\\xe2\\x80\\x94or lack thereof\\xe2\\x80\\x94remains unclear. This study extends existing knowledge by assessing gender inequality in household food (in) security among small-holder farm households in urban and rural areas of South Africa. In doing-so, we use the gender of the head of household and treatment effects framework. Our results show that male-headed households are more food secure compared to female-headed households, with the latter depending more on agriculture to increase household food levels. We further find that the household food security gap between male- and female-headed households is wider in rural than in urban areas, where rural male- and female-headed households are more likely to report chronic food insecurity, i.e., are more likely than their urban counterparts to experience hunger. Interestingly, the effects of climatic characteristics on household food security are more apparent in rural than in urban areas. Our findings suggest that household food security initiatives are likely to be more effective, in closing the gender gap in household food security, if aligned with policies on urban and rural agriculture and development.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: food security; male-headed household; female-headed households; urban; rural; South Africa\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Fred M.

A series of significant developments have taken place in these sectors over the past decade that are positively associated with the promotion of HIA in the ROI. However, it is argued that in spite of various institutional facilitators, the practice of implementing HIAs in the ROI is significantly underdeveloped, and it continues to lag behind several of its European Union counterparts.

Environmental degradation often reduces property value in the housing market. However, the studies attempted to assess the value of environmental amenities and dis-amenities in the housing market of Bangladesh are scarce. Hence, this study examines the economic value of environmental (dis)amenities in the housing market of Khulna city, Bangladesh. Hedonic pricing method was used to assess the value of four environmental attributes - ventilation, open space, waterlogging and landfill by waste in the housing market. The study found these environmental attributes explain the variation of house rents significantly. Environmental amenities\\xe2\\x80\\x93a hundred-meter reduction in proximity to open space leads to a 2 percent increase in rent while a one discrete unit increase in a 5-point ventilation improvement scale from very poor to excellent results in 5.4 rent increase\\xe2\\x80\\x93are found as rent booster in the urban housing market. In contrast, waterlogging and landfill by waste reduce house rents by 3.7 and 9.8 percent for one unit increase in the respective 5-point degradation scales. The further analysis showed that the rental price of planned residential areas is more sensitive to ventilation and landfilling while that of unplanned areas is more sensitive to both environmental dis-amenities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 water-logging and landfilling. Furthermore, our study computed the implicit price of these environmental (dis)amenities in the housing markets of Khulna city. This study suggests improving environmental quality boosts house rent, which in turn attracts environment-friendly urbanization.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban environment; Hedonic pricing method; Marginal willingness to pay; Implicit price; Environmental amenities\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dominic A.

Despite their rising numbers, the living conditions and wellbeing of older Ghanaians remain woefully understudied. This paper presents the results of a study exploring the quality of life (QoL) of older adults in two contrasting neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana. The objectives of the study were to: (1) explore and compare the QoL of older slum and non-slum dwellers in Ghana; and (2) determine the extent of QoL disparities between slum and non-slum older adults. To accomplish these objectives, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of older adults (N = 603) residing in a slum and non-slum neighbourhood. QoL was self-assessed in four domains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 physical, psychological, social, and environment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 using the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL assessment tool (WHOQoL-BREF). Multivariable linear regression analyses of the data revealed no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical (coeff: 0.5; 95% CI: -1.7, 2.8;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.642) and psychological (coeff: -0.2; 95% CI: -3.0, 2.6;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.893) QoL. However, the slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than the non-slum respondents (coeff: -3.2; 95% CI: -5.6, -0.8;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.010), while the reverse was true in environmental QoL (coeff: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 6.2; p < 0.001). The existence of strong social support systems in the slum and better housing and neighbourhood environmental conditions in the non-slum may have accounted for the observed variation in social and environmental QoL. Thus,\\xe2\\x80\\xafcontrary to popular discourses that vilify slums as health-damaging milieus, these findings offer a more nuanced picture, and suggest that some features of slums may constitute important health resources for older adults.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gina Chowa, David Ansong, Rainier Masa,\\r\\n', b'Assets and child well-being in developing countries: A research review,\\r\\n', b'Children and Youth Services Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 32, Issue 11,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1508-1519,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0190-7409,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.03.015.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740910000794)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: The impact of assets on child well-being in developing countries has received considerable attention in the last decade. Increased recognition of the critical role played by assets in enhancing children's well-being has spurred efforts to study the relationship between assets and a range of outcomes for children. This chapter reviews current studies (i.e., conducted within the past 10years) that explore the relationship between asset ownership and a range of outcomes. The studies we have included in this review illustrate the impact that assets can have on children's outcomes in the area of health, education, and child labor. Overall, the studies reviewed show that asset ownership improves children's health conditions, advance schooling outcomes, and decrease incidence of child labor. Further research on the asset effects for child outcomes can inform progressive asset-building initiatives that will provide impetus for programs and policies to enhance household well-being in developing countries.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Assets; Children; Developing countries; Child well-being\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Bj\\xc3\\xb6rn Gustafsson, Ding Sai,\\r\\n', b\"China's urban poor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Comparing twice poverty between residents and migrants in 2013 and 2018,\\r\\n\", b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 80,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'102012,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2023.102012.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000974)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Using data from the China Household Income Project in 2013 and 2018, this paper studies relative poverty among rural hukou holders living in urban China and urban hukou holders. People living in households with an income below a fixed percent of the median per-capita income and wealth below the same fixed percent of the median per-capita wealth among urban residents are deemed as relative poor. Although migrants with rural hukou living in urban China were more prone to twice poverty than urban residents in 2013, this was not generally the case in 2018. A multivariate analysis shows several factors to be related to the probability of being twice relative poor. Even considering these factors, a rural hukou status increased the probability of being twice relative poor in 2013. In contrast, such an excess risk of being twice relative poor was much lesser outspoken in middle and low-ranking cities in 2018. However, rural to urban migrants living in high-ranking cities had a somewhat higher risk of being relative poor than urban residents with the same characteristics in 2018.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Urban China; Rural to urban migrants; Urban residents; Twice poverty; China household income project\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'D.J.H. te Lintelo, J.

Sluggish growth in farm productivity in SSA has brought to the fore the key role of agricultural technology in alleviating future food insecurity. We develop a model of technology, food security and international trade with three distinct channels for technology reduce food insecurity in SSA. The first is via greater domestic R&D investment. An alternative is to import technologies from other countries with significant knowledge capital. The third role for technology to resolve the Malthusian dilemma in SSA is that of \\xe2\\x80\\x98virtual technology trade\\xe2\\x80\\x99, i.e., importing technological investments undertaken elsewhere through cheaper imported food. To assess the relative contribution of each channel to food security in Africa, we employ a partial equilibrium, quantitative trade model, augmented by a temporal relationship between R&D investments, knowledge capital and agricultural productivity. Over the historical period: 1991-2011 we find that direct R&D investments in SSA have been the dominant vehicle for lowering food prices in Africa. Looking forward to 2050, we find that virtual technology trade will be the most important vehicle for reducing non-farm undernutrition in Africa.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Population growth; Technological progress; Undernutrition; Malthus; Agriculture\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jessie X.

However, relevant studies in Chinese cities are rare. Little attention has been paid to accessibility modelling, variations among population groups, and the influence of land use arrangement and transport infrastructure in Chinese cities. To address this deficiency, the present paper provides measures on the job accessibility of workers with different hukou status in Guangzhou. The study yields the following findings: 1) inner-city districts have better job accessibility compared to suburban areas; 2) local hukou workers have significantly higher job accessibility than non-local hukou workers; 3) job suburbanization seems not to be effective in improving job accessibility or narrowing the gap between local and non-local hukou workers; and 4) investment in public transport would significantly improve the mobility and job accessibility of non-local hukou workers and help to alleviate accessibility inequality.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Land use; Mobility; Job accessibility; Hukou; Guangzhou\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Chaham Alalouch, Sara Al-Hajri, Abeer Naser, Asma Al Hinai,\\r\\n', b'The impact of space syntax spatial attributes on urban land use in Muscat: Implications for urban sustainability,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 46,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'101417,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.01.002.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670718306243)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: It is widely accepted that land-use distribution has a direct impact on urban sustainability. This study examines the relationship between land-use distribution and the spatial structure of street networks in newly developed neighborhoods as a contribution to urban sustainability. Two new neighborhoods in Muscat, Oman, were examined using Space Syntax theory. The land use maps were developed through exhaustive site visits, while the spatial analysis was generated using DepthMapX software. The following four spatial attributes were included: Integration, Control, Choice, and Normalized Least Angle Choice (NACH). The land use variables were Retail, Residential and Mix-use. The statistical analysis showed that the distribution of the Residential land use is significantly influenced by the spatial attributes in highly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spatial configurations, with NACH being the best predictor followed by Integration. In addition, the degree to which an area has a formal grid structure was found to have no effect on the relationship between the variables. Thus, this paper contributes to urban sustainability, Space Syntax, and land-use distribution studies by providing evidence on how spatial arrangements influence land-use distribution, and consequently, energy use, demand for services, and patterns of urban traffic. The study concludes with recommendations to the planning authorities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban sustainability; Land use; Space syntax; Street network; Oman; Integration; Normalized least angle choice\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Florence Abugtane Avogo, Emmanuel Akiweley Wedam, Seth Mensah Opoku,\\r\\n', b'Housing transformation and livelihood outcomes in Accra, Ghana,\\r\\n', b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 68,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 92-103,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.05.009.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275116308228)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: New trends in urban growth in Accra have put many poor households at a detriment, and there is a growing fragility that threatens the economic and social balance of residence in public estates resulting in many transforming their residence to cope and as a new form of urban resilience. This study examines housing transformation and livelihood outcomes in one of Ghana's largest low cost government estates, constructed in 1975 in Accra. The authors collected field data using questionnaires, interviews, observations and field pictures. The study revealed that housing transformation in public estates are a strategy to address shortfalls' associated with the physical design, structure and construction paucities, especially in living space, lifestyle and size, and for addressing pecuniary and livelihood challenges through home-based enterprises. Household needs and household assets were the significant factors affecting transformations. This study is important for policy making in developing countries because it provides a basis for policy implementation for urban and regional planners. Housing and building policies must be swotted to reflect the effort of local performance in housing supply and livelihoods.

This study examines how community socioeconomic status (SES) influences children's self-rated health and nutritional status in urban and rural China and explores whether the effects of community SES vary by a child's gender and family background. Using data from the China Family Penal Studies in 2010, this study focuses on children aged 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9315 years old living in 261 urban neighborhoods and 293 rural villages in China. Multilevel regression models are estimated to examine the effect of community SES on the probability of reporting poor/fair health and nutritional status measured by height for age while controlling for individual and family characteristics. The results suggest that community SES has a positive and curvilinear effect on children's health and nutritional status in urban China, and it only positively influences children's nutrition in rural China. Community SES has a stronger effect for boys than for girls, and for children in poorer families and families with lower levels of parental involvement.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: China; Community environment; Neighborhood effect; Children; Health inequalities; Nutrition\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Michael Adu Okyere, Felix Essel-Gaisey, Fawzia Muhammed Zuka, Aaron Kobina Christian, Isaac Kwamena Nunoo,\\r\\n', b'Wading out the storm: Exploring the effect of flooding on energy poverty amidst disaster management strategies in Dar es Salaam,\\r\\n', b'Environmental Science & Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 150,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'103578,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1462-9011,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103578.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901123002277)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Although flooding is well-thought-out as one of the deadliest natural disasters, there is scarce evidence on how such an environmental shock affect energy poverty prevelence in a developing country context amidst the implementation of disaster risk management strategies. Using the Disaster Poverty Household Survey in Tanzania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital Dar es Salaam, we examine the effect of flooding on multidimensional energy poverty while estimating the moderation effects of non-structural ex-ante risk management strategies. After employing a myriad of robust methods, we observe that flooding increases energy poverty prevalence by about 32 %. The mediation analysis shows that income reduction serves as a pathway through which flooding affects energy poverty. Furthermore, estimates from the interaction analysis reveal how effective fiscal non-structural ex-ante risk management methods are in reducing the incidence of energy poverty among flood victims. However, the defense strategies were noted to be inefficient. These results provide policymakers with the necessary tools to create policies that address energy-related needs in areas affected by natural disasters, especially in developing countries.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Flooding; Ex-ante risk management strategies; Developing economy; Moderation analysis; Micro-level study\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Md.

Although different TOD typologies have been developed in different contexts, they are based on subjective evaluation criteria derived from the context in which they are built and typically lack a validation measure. Arguably there exist sets of TOD characteristics that perform better in certain contexts, and being able to optimise TOD effectiveness would facilitate planning and supporting policy development. This research utilises data from census collection districts (CCDs) in Brisbane with different sets of TOD attributes measured across six objectively quantified built environmental indicators: net employment density, net residential density, land use diversity, intersection density, cul-de-sac density, and public transport accessibility. Using these measures, a Two Step Cluster Analysis was conducted to identify natural groupings of the CCDs with similar profiles, resulting in four unique TOD clusters: (a) residential TODs, (b) activity centre TODs, (c) potential TODs, and (d) TOD non-suitability. The typologies are validated by estimating a multinomial logistic regression model in order to understand the mode choice behaviour of 10,013 individuals living in these areas. Results indicate that in comparison to people living in areas classified as residential TODs, people who reside in non-TOD clusters were significantly less likely to use public transport (PT) (1.4 times), and active transport (4 times) compared to the car. People living in areas classified as potential TODs were 1.3 times less likely to use PT, and 2.5 times less likely to use active transport compared to using the car. Only a little difference in mode choice behaviour was evident between people living in areas classified as residential TODs and activity centre TODs. The results suggest that: (a) two types of TODs may be suitable for classification and effect mode choice in Brisbane; (b) TOD typology should be developed based on their TOD profile and performance matrices; (c) both bus stop and train station based TODs are suitable for development in Brisbane.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Transit Oriented Development (TOD); TOD typology; Advanced TOD planning; Mode choice behaviour; Public transport accessibility level (PTAL); Brisbane\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Hans Binswanger-Mkhize, Alex F.

The secular downward trend in agricultural prices ended in the early 1990s; growing incomes in Asia and Africa, combined with continued rapid population growth, are fueling food demand, which is expected to lead to a gradual upward trend in international real agricultural prices. For Africa the major agricultural growth opportunities will be in regional and domestic markets for food staples. To seize these opportunities, SSA will have to support economic growth via continued sound macroeconomic policies, further improvements in the investment climate, and investments in infrastructure and institutions. In the agricultural sector SSA will have to (1) remove the remaining agricultural taxation that still disadvantages African farmers relative to all other farmers in the world, (2) improve its services for small farmers, (3) significantly increase its investment in agricultural technology generation and dissemination at national and subregional levels, (4) empower local governments, communities, and farmer organizations for their own development via further administrative and fiscal decentralization and community-driven development, and (5) strengthen the already existing regional agricultural institutions for agricultural trade, biosafety, phytosanitary regulations, seed production, regulation and trade, and technology generation.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dinghong Xu, Kashif Raza Abbasi, Khadim Hussain, Abdullah Albaker, Abdulaziz I.

Recently, the prediction for energy consumption has intensified compared to its production capacity, which is problematic for Pakistan's social and economic stability. Hence, it is vital to examine the link between power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion from 1970 to 2018 in Pakistan. For analysis, the second-generation econometric technique of Lee and Strazicich (2013), novel Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL), and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) is useful to detect the long-medium and short-run association among the variables. The results show that power consumption stimulates economic expansion in the short and long-run, though the rise in power prices declines economic activity in the short and long-run. Also, urban transition and other electricity use are a substantial positive and negative impact on economic expansion in the short and long-run. The outcome suggests that efficient energy supply, low-cost power prices, proper urban transition management, and other energy use could be useful for policymakers to achieve SDGs 7 and 11 in Pakistan.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Power consumption; Power prices; Urban transition; Economic expansion; AARDL\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jane Wardani, Joannette J.

It is also imperative to understand its impact on a specific dimension of early childhood development, socioemotional development, beginning at an early age. Thus, the objective of this article was to conduct a systematic narrative review to examine the relationship between broader conceptions of SES and young children's social-emotional development. The findings suggest that SES begins to have a negative impact on social-emotional development early in life.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Anxiety; Child development; Depression; Infant mental health; Internalizing behavior; Poverty; Prosocial behavior; Social-emotional development; Socioeconomic status; Systematic narrative review; Withdrawn\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'S.

Across the globe, nearly one in ten people is without access to an improved drinking water source. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are the most affected, having disproportionately more of the global population without access to clean water than other major regions. Population growth, changing lifestyles, increasing pollution and accelerating urbanization will continue to widen the gap between the demand for water and available supply especially in urban areas, and disproportionately affect informal settlements, where the majority of SSA's urban population resides. Distribution and allocation of water will be affected by climate-induced water stresses, poor institutions, ineffective governance, and weak political will to address scarcity and mediate uncertainties in future supply. While attempts have been made by many scientists to examine different dimensions of water scarcity and urban population dynamics, there are few comprehensive reviews, especially focused on the particular situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper contributes to interdisciplinary understanding of urban water supply by distilling and integrating relevant empirical knowledge on urban dynamics and water issues in SSA, focusing on progress made and associated challenges. It then points out future research directions including the need to understand how alternatives to centralized water policies may help deliver sustainable water supply to cities and informal settlements in the region.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban dynamics; Water scarcity; Water access; Governance; Sub-Saharan Africa; Population\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shuangshuang Tang, Pu Hao, Xianjin Huang,\\r\\n', b'Land conversion and urban settlement intentions of the rural population in China: A case study of suburban Nanjing,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 51,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 149-158,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.10.023.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751500226X)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Rapid urban expansion in China has created a large population of landless farmers. Because these landless farmers are under-compensated for land acquisition and discriminated against by urban institutions, many of them face tremendous difficulties in their urban lives. Consequently, rural citizens generally resist land acquisition and conversion to urban residency. However, given the recent improvements in land compensation standards, the educational qualifications of the rural population and urban employment opportunities, the situation is likely to change. Based on a 2014 survey conducted in Nanjing's suburban Jiangning District, this paper examines the land conversion and settlement intentions of rural citizens under the new circumstances. Both in-depth interviews with local villagers and regression models suggest that relinquishing farmland and housing land and settling in the city are distinct decisions determined by dissimilar factors. The findings suggest that a compensation scheme that integrates rural land requisition and resettlement allocation barely meets the requirements of the affected villagers, which explains the observed resistance of rural citizens to land conversion and urban settlement.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Land conversion; Rural migrants; hukou; Settlement intentions; Nanjing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'C.

Food banks, the primary response to food poverty on the ground, typically rely on community referral and distribution systems that involve health and social care professionals and local authority public health teams. The perspectives of these key stakeholders remain underexplored. This paper reports on a qualitative study of the health and wellbeing challenges of food poverty and food banking in London. An ethnographic investigation of food bank staff and users was carried out alongside a series of healthcare stakeholder interviews. A total of 42 participants were interviewed. A Critical Grounded Theory (CGT) analysis revealed that contemporary lived experiences of food poverty are embedded within and symptomatic of extreme marginalisation, which in turn impacts upon health. Specifically, food poverty was conceptualised by participants to: firstly, be a barrier to providing adequate care and nutrition for young children; secondly, be exacerbated by lack of access to adequate fresh food, food storage and cooking facilities; and thirdly, amplify existing health and social problems. Further investigation of the local government structures and professional roles that both rely upon and serve to further embed the food banking system is necessary in order to understand the politics of changing welfare landscapes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food poverty; London; Qualitative; Health inequalities; Food banks; Diet\\r\\n', b'\\n', b\"Achim Buerkle, Amy O'Dell, Harveen Matharu, Linda Buerkle, Pedro Ferreira,\\r\\n\", b'Recommendations to align higher education teaching with the UN sustainability goals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A scoping survey,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Educational Research Open,\\r\\n', b'Volume 5,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'100280,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2666-3740,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2023.100280.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666374023000559)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Global challenges such as climate change, limited resources, and an ever-growing world population demonstrate a perceptible impact on the lives of people around the globe. To tackle the arising issues and to enable peace and prosperity in the future, the United Nations (UN) have defined 17 interlinked sustainable development goals. A major facilitator to achieve these goals is considered through education. Consequently, higher education institutes have started to align their curricula with sustainable development. Yet, lesser attention has been paid to teaching methods themselves. Hence, in this paper, a scoping survey is performed on how higher education teaching can be inspired by the UN sustainable development goals, specifically, by a summarized subset of 7 goals: (1) Tackle Poverty, (2) Enable Good Health and Well-Being, (3) Establish Quality Education, (4) Reduce Inequalities, (5) Embrace Environmental Sustainability, (6) Foster Innovation, and (7) Establish Partnerships. Overall, the discussed recommendations show a promising potential towards having a positive impact on higher education, yet, also unveil conflicts between different goals.

It has dramatically changed the policy landscape in the rice sector and generated heated debates on how it would affect food security and poverty. This study explores the welfare effects of this reform across different types of households. We rely on the IRRI Global Rice Model to simulate the domestic price effects of the reform (Bali\\xc3\\xa9 and Valera, 2020) and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to study the welfare impact of these price changes. Our results show that the RTL reduces consumer and producer rice prices, which affects households on the production and the consumption sides. Because a large majority of households are net buyers of rice and the policy reform reduces rice prices, most households benefit from the reform. Overall, the effects of the reform on poverty are beneficial. The poorest quintiles are positively affected, while the richest quintiles are unaffected or slightly worse-off. Spatially, the poorest regions also benefit the most. However, the rice growers who are net sellers are negatively impacted. The government should seek to mitigate the negative effects on non-competitive rice growers. Investments in public goods and services are a promising option to ease the emergence of on-farm and off-farm businesses as more profitable alternatives to rice production.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Welfare effects; Regional analysis; Price change; Rice policy; Philippines\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mingxing Chen, Yuwen Sui, Weidong Liu, Hui Liu, Yaohuan Huang,\\r\\n', b'Urbanization patterns and poverty reduction: A new perspective to explore the countries along the Belt and Road,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 84,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1-14,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.12.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751830852X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Urbanization and poverty reduction are two vital aspects for global sustainable and healthy development. In the future, the countries along the Belt and Road will play a more important role in global urbanization and poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper aims at elaborating the characteristics and patterns of urbanization and poverty reduction in these countries using data from 1996 to 2016. The results indicate that the average urbanization level is 48% in 2016 and the average annual growth rate of these countries is 0.61 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. In addition, West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have a higher level of urbanization, while ultra-high-speed and high-speed development countries are primarily Southeast Asian countries and China. Furthermore, these countries differentiate significantly in terms of spatial distribution of population density. Regions with a population density of 0\\xe2\\x80\\x931 person per square kilometer account for 33% of the total area and 0.09% of the total population, while regions with a population density of over 1000 people per square kilometer account for 1.45% of the total area and 39.56% of the total population. Moreover, using mathematical morphology methods, we identify the 10 regions with the largest urban land areas among these countries, and seven regions are located in China and Southeast Asia. Finally, the population living in extreme poverty in these countries dropped from 1.17 billion to 355.6 million during the 20-year period, and several countries, such as China, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, have made tremendous progress both in urbanization and poverty reduction. These findings are beneficial for comprehending urban development and poverty reduction in the countries along the Belt and Road as well as for providing references for regional cooperation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urbanization; Characteristic; Pattern; Poverty reduction; GIS; The Belt and Road\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Akwasi Kumi-Kyereme, Joshua Amo-Adjei,\\r\\n', b'Household wealth, residential status and the incidence of diarrhoea among children under-five years in Ghana,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health,\\r\\n', b'Volume 6, Issue 3,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 131-140,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6006,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2015.05.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600615000581)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This study examines the impact that the joint effect of household wealth quintile and urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural residence has on the incidence of diarrhoea among Ghanaian children. Data for this paper were drawn from the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) of 2006. Descriptive and logistic regression was applied to analyse data on 3466 children. Rural residents are less likely, albeit insignificant, to report diarrhoea compared with those in urban areas. Significant wealth gradients are manifested in childhood experiences of diarrhoea. However, an interaction of wealth with residence does not show significant disparities. Controlling for other important covariates of childhood, the odds of diarrhoea incidence were significantly higher among: the rural poorer (OR=4.869; 95% CI=0.792, 29.94), the rural middle (OR=7.477; 95% CI=1.300, 42.99), the rural richer (OR=6.162; 95% CI=0.932, 40.74) and the rural richest (OR=6.152; 95% CI=0.458, 82.54). Apart from residential status and wealth quintile, female children (OR=0.441; 95% CI=0.304, 0.640), older children (OR=0.968; 95% CI=0.943, 0.993), having a mother with secondary and higher education (OR=0.313; 95% CI) had lesser odds of experiencing diarrhoea. The findings show that there is a need to apportion interventions intended to improve child health outcomes even beyond residential status and household wealth position.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Wealth status; Residence; Diarrhoea; Children; Ghana\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Antonio Flavio Dias Avila, Luis Romano, Fernando Garagorry,\\r\\n', b'Chapter 71 Agricultural Productivity in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sources of Growth,\\r\\n', b'Handbook of Agricultural Economics,\\r\\n', b'Elsevier,\\r\\n', b'Volume 4,\\r\\n', b'2010,\\r\\n', b'Pages 3713-3768,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1574-0072,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780444518743,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0072(09)04071-7.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040717)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Agricultural productivity in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries between 1961 and 2001 increased due to market regulation, economic openness, and estate reduction.

While it may have significant impacts on various dimensions of development and sustainability, this study focuses on its effect on the level of food security of the overall population (SDG 2). Although there are many reasons to suppose that electricity access is positively related to food security, such impacts are expected to accrue through both immediate and income-mediated routes whose size and prevalence are unknown. The immediate impacts of electricity access on food security refer to the effects on food production (availability) and on food conservation and preparation (utilization). Income-mediated impacts include cross-sectoral productivity increases and the creation of new economic activities, generating new income that, in turn, would improve the economic access to food. After theoretically discussing the two kinds of impacts, this work empirically verifies how the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1) is related to the percentage of population with access to electricity (SDG indicator 7.1.1) in a panel of 54 developing countries over the period 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932014. By adopting a multi-step estimation method, we disentangle the immediate effects of electricity access on food security from the income-mediated effects that stem from changes in GDP per capita and its distribution. Results show that electricity access mainly exerts immediate impacts on food availability and utilization, with only one fifth of impacts coming from income-mediated effects. This finding may lead policy-makers to prioritize off-grid electricity investments in proximity of vulnerable households through small-scale and household-level electricity systems, which may improve food security by immediately affecting the local and subsistence food production, conservation and preparation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Food security; Electricity access; Income distribution; Multi-step estimation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Leopoldo Laborda, M.

There are numerous studies that examine the impact of urbanisation on the environment but no known study has analysed whether the impact of urbanisation on the environment is dependent on the characteristics of available infrastructure. To address this gap, this study uses the STIRPAT model, panel cointegration and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) estimator as well as panel data of eight Asian countries to analyse whether private sector investment in the transport sector and transport infrastructure mode influences the impact of urbanisation on transport CO2 emissions. We find that the effect of urbanisation on transport CO2 emissions depends on the covariates in the model and interactions with other factors. Increase in income and population increases transport CO2 emissions while technological improvements reduces CO2 emissions from the transport sector. Private sector investment in the transport sector and availability of rail infrastructure reduce transport CO2 emissions; and given the same level of urbanisation, Asian countries with more rail infrastructure and private sector investment in the transport sector tend to have lower CO2 emission from the transport sector. Policy makers in Asia should make efforts to boost private sector participation in the transport sector and also promote the construction and improvement of rail infrastructure in order to reduce urbanisation-induced transport CO2 emissions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urbanisation; Transport sector; Private sector investment; CO2 emission; Asia\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Anne-Claire Thomas, Fr\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9ric Gaspart,\\r\\n', b'Does Poverty Trap Rural Malagasy Households?,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 67,\\r\\n', b'2015,\\r\\n', b'Pages 490-505,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.11.012.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X14003702)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'This paper contributes to the understanding of the persistently high poverty rates in rural Madagascar.

Focussing on recent progress in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong, this research investigates the Government regulations and market responses. It is found that simply relieving the regulations and institutional constraints in revitalisation does not work, either for the policy aim in a narrow sense or for the local economy in a broad sense. New revitalisation measures by the Government have led to new constraints in revitalisation. It is necessary to address the policy lag. This paper presents an opening statement of discussing effectiveness of revitalisation policy in terms of urban competitiveness. It advocates some general principles and goals been taken into account in making revitalisation policy, including industrial diversity, indigenously owned companies, social costs and quality of life.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Industrial building; Revitalisation; High-density; Policy evaluation; Hong Kong\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'F.L.

Ensuring a fair implementation process is important when considering an equitable PES scheme. Currently the implications, such as impacts on social dynamics and participant perceptions, of auctions at both the individual and community level are poorly understood. Using a case study a long-standing and well-established PES scheme in Sumberjaya, Indonesia, we aim to explore the relationship between farmer characteristics and their perceived auction fairness/satisfaction and impacts on the community social dynamics. We find that a fair auction process allowing all to participate leads to perceived fairness at the individual level. However, at the community level, we find that individuals perceive more social impacts. Our results also find that information quality is the main factor in increasing fairness and reducing community impacts. Our results suggest that while it is possible to have an equitable implementation process, ensuring procedural equity may potentially compromise contextual equity. These results can aid in the implementation of PES schemes and shed some light into which characteristics to identify within potential participants and communities to avoid social disruptions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Participant perceptions; Social dynamics; Justice; Conservation auction; Incentive-based conservation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Simon Feeny, Lachlan McDonald, Alberto Posso,\\r\\n', b'Are Poor People Less Happy?

Findings also reveal differentiated effects in the two indicators accounting for greater deprivation. The impacts on reducing extreme income poverty and extreme multidimensional poverty are more significant for the rural sector than for the urban sector.

This paper presents the economic modelling using Fiji's Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002/03 dataset to examine the economic and social factors crucial for poverty reduction. Two hypotheses are tested: first, we estimate the monetary effects of education at the aggregate and disaggregated returns to education (primary, secondary, tertiary levels) and by income quartiles, and second, test the non-monetary education and health factors as channels of impact promulgated as effects against poverty prevalence. The monetary results indicate that all income quartile households (i.e. lowest to highest) benefit from additional skills obtained through formal education. While those at the lowest income quartile in particular benefit the most from formal education, however it cannot sustainably prevent people with only primary education from falling into poverty. The results for non-monetary models show that education has a positive and significant influence on the tendency of the people to engage in health prevention activities and in acquiring good housing facilities.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Poverty; Econometrics; Monetary models; Non-monetary models; Fiji\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ronald Oaxaca,\\r\\n', b'Discrimination, Economics of,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

In economics, as in ordinary parlance, discrimination typically carries a pejorative connotation. The term is generally reserved for distinctions that are socially unacceptable and economically inefficient. Economic theories of discrimination can be categorized into theories about tastes and preferences of economic agents, economic power, and statistical discrimination. Achieving a consensus on what the broad features of discrimination in markets, especially labor markets, should entail is a seemingly straightforward task compared with obtaining a consensus on empirical measures of discrimination. The standard measurement technique is that of wage decompositions. With the advent of newer and more sophisticated econometric methods for estimating earning relationships, measurement of discrimination has become more ambiguous. Legal and employee morale considerations constrain attempts to remove discrimination in the workplace in a way that would correspond to accepted economic principles of efficiency. Comparable worth seeks to remedy discrimination by relying upon experts to value job attributes in an unbiased manner. Empirical studies of labor-market discrimination are global in nature and encompass both developed countries and developing countries.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Consensus; Differentiation; Earnings potential; Income inequality; Median income; Monopsony power; Pejorative connotation; Reduced competition; Segregation; Wage decompositions\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'James M.

With the increasing number of households engaging in the practice, a local NGO in 2009 introduced community gardens in the city of Gweru to vulnerable households as a new development initiative. We examine the feasibility of community resource management in these gardens using a blend of econometrics and community resource management theory. The study finds that sex of head of household, household labour, on-plot area, and off-plot area significantly affected the decision to practice community gardening. Results also show that households characterised by food insecurity tended to be the participants in community gardens. Strong social capital made it possible for these households to participate in community management of resources. However, there is need to remove obstacles such as uncertainty of tenure. Given the potential of urban agriculture in alleviating food insecurity, urban authorities need to consider their position that the practice causes river siltation and include it in their planning processes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Key words; Binary logistic; Community gardens; Food security; Heterogeneity; Urban agriculture; Zimbabwe\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Wisdom Akpalu, Aaron K.

However, publicly managed hydro-modernist sanitation systems are not available to all, with many households and communities across the world having to access basic off-grid, state-provided sanitation services, such as pit latrines or Urine Diversion Dehydration Toilets, or having to provide their own solutions to sanitation waste. Urban green sanitation, which is non-sewered and off-grid, represents a new form of hydro-social and socio-technical relations. It aims to address sanitation backlogs and provide an alternative to centralised sanitation systems using ecological circularity. This paper categorises the social acceptability of urban green sanitation technologies into four main dimensions: social concerns, environmental concerns, the right to sanitation, and making a contribution to change.

I explain the positive correlation observed between slum growth and economic growth in cities with three IV-estimated structural elasticities. The number of low-income households in a city increases with wages with an elasticity of 1.7. Housing rents increase with housing demand with elasticities of 0.37 for non-slum housing and 0.07 for slum housing. Economic growth in cities thus causes slum growth because it attracts large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing. I further show that as economic growth improves households\\xe2\\x80\\x99 incomes nationwide, an income effect reduces the national slum share. Finally, I find that two policy-relevant counterfactuals significantly increase aggregate income by relocating households into high-wage cities: 1) slum upgrading in high-wage cities 2) reducing the elasticity of non-slum housing rents to housing demand shocks.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Housing; Slums; Urbanization; Brazil\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Tim Smeeding,\\r\\n', b'Poverty, Sociology of,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

Herein, we examine several approaches and concepts of poverty measurement. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, but all end up with some definition or description of poverty and the attributes of the poor. Also debated are the sociological theories of why poverty exists, and its relation to family, culture, and context. Sociologists have provided important tools for testing causal hypotheses concerning the explanations, causes, and cures for poverty regardless of how it is measured. These include place, culture, stratification, space, race, gender, imprisonment, and other popular theories of poverty in sociology. Sociological studies of poverty have both a rich heritage and have become an important area of research in increasingly unequal rich and poor societies.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Crime; Culture of poverty; Family structure; Mass imprisonment; Neighborhood effects; Poverty; Poverty line; Poverty measurement; Social mobility; Social stratification; Spatial inequality\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Atanasio Tembe, Fumihiko Nakamura, Shinji Tanaka, Ryo Arioshi, Shino Miura,\\r\\n', b'Travel Behavior of the Urban Poor: A Comparative Study between Maputo and Nairobi,\\r\\n', b'Transportation Research Procedia,\\r\\n', b'Volume 48,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1478-1492,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2352-1465,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.193.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146520306104)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Commuters from poor households face increased challenges in their daily mobility in Sub-Saharan African cities, yet studies on their travel behavior are rare. Most poor individuals resort to walking long distances because they cannot afford motorcycles, bicycles, or even a single bus trip. Using person-trip data, this paper tries to investigate travel behavior of the urban poor through a comparative study between Maputo City and Nairobi City. The logistic regression results showed some similarities and variations among the factors affecting the travel behavior of the urban poor in Maputo City and Nairobi City. The likelihood of choosing Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) over public transport decreased with ownership of motorcycles and private cars in both cities. Surprisingly, gender had no impact on the likelihood of selecting NMT either in Maputo or Nairobi. This might indicate that men and women are equally likely to walk. Variations were observed with respect to the effect of age and residence location. For example, while the likelihood of selecting NMT is positively correlated with the residential location in Maputo, a negative relationship was observed for Nairobi.

This paper examines whether differences in banking sector penetration across Indian districts explain the differences in firm start-ups in Indian informal sector. Our empirical strategy lies in examining the effect of the spread of banking facilities at the district level on new firm formation in the informal sector for the period 1994\\xe2\\x80\\x931995 to 2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932011.

However, much remains unknown about activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in developing countries. Can we expect similarity between activity participation and travel behaviour of non-workers in different income group households in developing countries? How do the socio-demographic settings in India, for e.g., traditional gender roles and multi-member households, and land use context influence the activity-travel choices of non-workers in different income group households? The present study attempts to answer these questions by presenting a comparative analysis of activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in low-, medium-, and high-income households in Bangalore city, India. Using a primary activity-travel survey data, the study mainly compares the activity-travel behaviour of the three income-groups with respect to various activity-travel indicators. In addition, statistical models of daily out-of-home time allocation, trip chaining, and mode choice behaviour are estimated separately for the three groups to investigate the potential sensitivity of the groups to various factors influencing these behaviour indicators. The study findings suggest that the low-income group non-workers are more mobility-constrained than others, apparent from longer walk trip length and the lower dependency on other modes of transport. The low-income group appears to make more social stops than the other two groups, probably a reflection of social-connections due to the increased dependency on walking. However, the number of recreational and shopping stops made by this group appears to be significantly lower than the other two groups. Further, the influence of mixed residential development on low-income group individuals' maintenance and discretionary activity time allocation decision appears to be insignificant. Overall, the study suggests that future land use planning for Bangalore might ensure that all groups of individuals have equal access (in terms of travel time/distance) to basic facilities.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Activity-based analysis; Bangalore; India; Income groups; Non-workers\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jonathan Rigg, Albert Salamanca, Eric C.

This has been the experience in much of the global North and it was expected to occur as development proceeded in the global South. In East and Southeast Asia, however, smallholders have persisted in the face of rapid and profound social and economic transformation. This presents the core puzzle that the paper addresses: why has the farm-size transition not occurred in much of East and Southeast Asia? Why have smallholders stubbornly resisted the tide of economic history? The first half of the paper defines the smallholder and smallholding, sets out the historical evolution of smallholdings in the region, and explores the role of smallholders in national development. The second half of the paper explains the persistence of the smallholder through three explanatory lenses: the economics of smallholder farming; the role of farm policy; and the logics of smallholder-based livelihoods in a context of global integration. The paper concludes by setting out four possible rural futures for the wider East Asian countryside and smallholder.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: East Asia; Southeast Asia; Smallholder; Farm-size transition; History; Development\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David A.

We first find that contrary to recent findings, undocumented Latinos do not replace blacks at the bottom of the locational attainment hierarchy. Whites continue to end up in neighborhoods that are less poor and whiter than minority groups, while all minorities, including undocumented Latinos, end up in neighborhoods that are of similar quality. Second, the effects of socioeconomic status for undocumented Latinos are either similar to or weaker than disadvantaged blacks. These findings suggest that living in less desirable neighborhoods is a fate disproportionately borne by non-white Los Angeles residents and that in some limited ways, the penalty attached to being undocumented Latino might actually be greater than the penalty attached to being black.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Residential segregation; Documentation status\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ajay Sharma, S.

The research adopted a mixed-method case study model that combines secondary sources and primary data gathering through semi-structured interviews of 25 returned market survivors, supported by 15 expert interviews among local and other government officials, practitioners and academics who are engaged in disaster management and urban planning. The empirical data reveal the importance of strengthening social relationships and cohesion as well as the crucial role of social capital in all stages of disaster management processes: prevention and preparedness, planning, warning communication, physical and psychological impacts, emergency and disaster response, recovery and reconstruction; and how these collectively motivate the survivors' return decision.

Findings summarise that accessibility and overall WASH performance during 2011-12 were better than 2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305. The change was not significant across cities in terms of WASH availability during the survey years. The availability of WASH was poor, but accessibility was better in Mumbai. Chennai reported a reverse trend, where availability was better, but accessibility was poor. The overall level of WASH became significantly better in Mumbai during 2011-12 compared to 2004-05, but changes were minor in other cities. The cities with poor WASH performance (Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai) exhibited more inequality compared to better performing cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi). The intra-city inequality is attributable to housing conditions, economic status, educational level, socio-religious affiliation, and occupational status.

While the positive relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth is generally well accepted, the impact of trade liberalization on poverty and income inequality is still unclear. The objective of this paper is to use real data and real trade agreements of the state of Pakistan, to examine the predictions made by trade models about the impact of trade liberalization on income inequality. To illustrate, the impacts of several alternative bilateral and regional free trade agreements are simulated on household income and income inequality in Pakistan. The results show that trade liberalization does not always lead to a decline in income inequality in the short run. Trade agreements that do improve income equality, favor agriculture and often hinge on a decline in urban and non-farm household income. In the long run, changes in income equality are more positive, suggesting that efforts might best be applied towards improving the mobility of labor and capital.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Income inequality; Trade liberalization; CGE modeling; Pakistan\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matamyo Simwanda, Yuji Murayama,\\r\\n', b'Spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use change in the rapidly growing city of Lusaka, Zambia: Implications for sustainable urban development,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 39,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 262-274,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.039.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670717309186)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This study examines the spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use (urban-LU) change in the rapidly urbanising city of Lusaka, Zambia, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using geospatial tools and techniques. The results show that the city experienced rapid urban growth, with about a 233% increase in the total urban-LU area from 1990 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 2010. The results also show that urban-LU expansion was more intense during the 2000s than during the 1990s. Spatially, the city displays a disordered pattern of urban-LU associated with the pattern of major roads and the city centre, which draws its legacies from the colonial era. Lusaka has emerged as a highly unplanned city with approximately 40% of the city representing unplanned residential land use dominated by informal settlements (30%). The growth of commercial and industrial land use has also been consistent with high density residential land uses. The growth of planned residential, and public institutions and service land uses has been slow. The results further reveal spatial dependency of informal settlements on commercial and industrial, and planned medium to high density residential land uses. The study discusses and offers vital insights for strategic urban planning that can control the observed unplanned urban growth and stimulate sustainable urban development.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban land use; Unplanned urban development; Intensity and gradient analysis; Spatial dependency modeling; GIS; Lusaka City\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Alex Ezeh, Oyinlola Oyebode, David Satterthwaite, Yen-Fu Chen, Robert Ndugwa, Jo Sartori, Blessing Mberu, G J Melendez-Torres, Tilahun Haregu, Samuel I Watson, Waleska Caiaffa, Anthony Capon, Richard J Lilford,\\r\\n', b'The history, geography, and sociology of slums and the health problems of people who live in slums,\\r\\n', b'The Lancet,\\r\\n', b'Volume 389, Issue 10068,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 547-558,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0140-6736,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31650-6.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616316506)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Massive slums have become major features of cities in many low-income and middle-income countries. Here, in the first in a Series of two papers, we discuss why slums are unhealthy places with especially high risks of infection and injury. We show that children are especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads to stunted growth and longer-term effects on cognitive development. We find that the scientific literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and health. This shortcoming is important because health is affected by factors arising from the shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone. In the second paper we will consider what can be done to improve health and make recommendations for the development of slum health as a field of study.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Chang Liu, Eleni Bardaka,\\r\\n', b'The suburbanization of poverty and changes in access to public transportation in the Triangle Region, NC,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 90,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'102930,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2020.102930.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692320310073)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: During the last 50\\xc2\\xa0years, a number of economic forces led to noteworthy changes in the geography of poverty in the US. Employment decentralization and lack of affordable housing have resulted in many low-income households migrating to suburban areas, and as of today, the majority of the low-income population of metropolitan regions resides in the suburbs. Focusing on the Triangle Region, NC, this study systematically explores the changes in the geography of poverty and transit access over time to better understand how accessibility to transit has changed for the low-income residents. Spatial panel data models are also estimated to investigate the relationship between poverty and transit access at the neighborhood level and how it varies spatially and temporally, while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Results indicate that between 1990 and 2015, the outer-ring suburbs experienced the highest increase in both poverty and transit access, although improvements in transit access were lower in the recently urbanized areas within the outer-ring suburbs. Inner-ring suburbs experienced a substantial rise in poverty rate and low-income population, and a comparable increase in transit access. Central cities remained the areas with the highest poverty rate and transit access in the Triangle Region but experienced smaller changes over time compared to suburban areas. The findings of the econometric analysis suggest that poverty rate and transit access are not significantly related at the neighborhood level when time-invariant unobservable characteristics are accounted for.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty suburbanization; Accessibility; Public transportation; Spatial analysis; Spatial panel data model\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Lu Liu, Jiaming Fang, Meng Li, Md Altab Hossin, Yunfei Shao,\\r\\n', b'The effect of air pollution on consumer decision making: A review,\\r\\n', b'Cleaner Engineering and Technology,\\r\\n', b'Volume 9,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'100514,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2666-7908,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2022.100514.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666790822001197)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Rapid industrialization and urbanization trends have brought many challenges, one of the most acute of which is air pollution. Until recently, scholars have primarily focused on the toll that air pollution exacts through its health effects while ignoring air pollution's impact on consumer behavior. The scattered research in the recent year reveals that air pollution might influence consumers' decision-making process before, during, and after consumptions in both online and offline contexts. However, no research to our knowledge has reviewed the influence effect of air quality on consumer behaviors, which impedes the scholars and practitioners from acquiring knowledge from this emerging field. This informative review aims to collect and analyze the existing scattered research for air pollution effects on consumer decision-making behavior. This review illustrates that the impact of air pollution on consumer behavior is rather extensive, ranging from health risks to emotional changes, from changes in daily habits to individual and group consumption behaviors. We propose that future research can potentially explore the impact of air pollution on consumers' consumption experience and evaluation behavior and examine the differential impacts of air pollution on consumers' individual and group consumption decisions.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Consumer decision making; Air pollution; Stimulus-organism-response framework; Environmental psychology; Literature review\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'E.H.

In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban inequality; New economy; Spatial inequality; Spatiality; Scale\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Awudu Abdulai, Victor Owusu, John-Eudes A.

Data on Amazonian mothers and their children, household demography and economics and direct, weighed measures of household food availability and dietary intakes of mother\\xe2\\x80\\x93child pairs were collected from 51 households to address the following research questions: (1) is there evidence of food scarcity in this setting?; (2) are there differences in energy and protein adequacy between children and their mothers?; and, (3) which individual and household-level factors are associated with these mother\\xe2\\x80\\x93child differences in energy and protein adequacy? In this context of food scarcity, we found that the majority of children had more adequate energy (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.001) and protein (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.001) intakes than their mothers. Multivariate OLS regression models showed that of the individual-level factors, child age and height-for-age were negatively associated with maternal-child energy and protein inequalities while maternal reproductive status (lactation) was positively associated with energy inequality. While there were no gender differences in dietary adequacy among children, boys had a larger advantage over their mothers in terms of protein adequacy than girls. Household food availability was related to maternal-child energy and protein inequalities in a curvilinear fashion with the lowest inequalities found in households with extremely low food availability and those with adequate food resources. This is the first study to quantify maternal-child dietary inequalities in a setting of food scarcity and demonstrates the importance of the household context and individual characteristics in understanding the degree to which mothers protect their children from resource scarcity.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Brazil; Amazon; Food security; Intra-household resource distribution; Parental investment; Nutrition; Food provisioning\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Amit Thorat, Reeve Vanneman, Sonalde Desai, Amaresh Dubey,\\r\\n', b'Escaping and Falling into Poverty in India Today,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 93,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 413-426,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.01.004.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17300062)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'The study examines the dynamic nature of movements into and out of poverty over a period when poverty has fallen substantially in India.

Our measurement focuses on anti-social behavior in a Joy-of-destruction lab game. We find that only the religious treatment decreased the propensity to destroy the payoffs of others.

We found that Dibao participation rate increased during this period, but its mis-targeting rate also increased. In both years, the Dibao benefit gap remained substantial, accounting for about one quarter of the potential full post-Dibao income of all eligible families. Using a propensity score matching method to identify non-participating families comparable to participating families, we found that Dibao had significant poverty reduction effects in both years, and the effect was larger in 2007 than in 2002. However, Dibao was unable to eliminate poverty among its target population, with notable poverty rate, gap, and severity remaining in both years. Future policy reforms should focus on the improvement of Dibao's anti-poverty effectiveness by better targeting, narrowing the benefit gap, and addressing not only the poverty rate but also the poverty gap and severity.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Welfare; Targeting; Poverty; Dibao; China; Urban\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ismail Haque, Md Juel Rana, Priyank Pravin Patel,\\r\\n', b'Location matters: Unravelling the spatial dimensions of neighbourhood level housing quality in Kolkata, India,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 99,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'102157,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102157.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397518310257)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Z.

Concerning the impact of projected R&D investments on agricultural productivity, it is found that endogenous growth rates of land-augmenting technical change are comparably lower than the standard exogenous rates used in long term projections of agri-food markets.

Vulnerability, meaning susceptibility to harm, is attributable to social determinants that limit access to assets, leading to greater exposure and sensitivity to stressors and a limited capacity to adapt. Stressors and adaptation are intertwined because stressors deplete resources available for adaptation, while adaptation may erode resources available to respond to future stressors. We present empirical evidence demonstrating the interactions of multiple stressors and adaptations over time through a case study of indigenous farmers in highland Bolivia. We examine how farmers perceive the stress on their livelihoods, their strategies for adapting to these threats, and the influence of past adaptation and exposure on vulnerability under increasing climatic change. We find that vulnerability changes over time as multiple stressors, such as land scarcity and delayed seasonal rainfall, compound, simultaneously reducing access and demanding the expenditure of household assets for adaptation, including natural capital (water and land), human capital (including labor), and financial, physical, and social capital. To reduce vulnerability over time, constraints on access to key resources must be addressed, allowing households the flexibility to reduce their exposure and improve their adaptive capacity to the multiple stressors they confront.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Adaptation; Access; Livelihoods; Climate change; Andes; Bolivia; Agriculture; Multiple stressors\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'James W.N.

Ecosystem classification is an approach that entails quantifying the social and ecological processes that shape ecosystem conditions into logical and relatively homogeneous management units, making the potential for ecosystem-based decision support available to urban planners. The purpose of this study is to develop and propose a framework for urban forest ecosystem classification (UFEC). The multifactor framework integrates 12 ecosystem components that characterize the biophysical landscape, built environment, and human population. This framework is then applied at the neighbourhood scale in Toronto, Canada, using hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis used 27 spatially-explicit variables to quantify the ecosystem components in Toronto. Twelve ecosystem classes were identified in this UFEC application. Across the ecosystem classes, tree canopy cover was positively related to economic wealth, especially income. However, education levels and homeownership were occasionally inconsistent with the expected positive relationship with canopy cover. Open green space and stocking had variable relationships with economic wealth and were more closely related to population density, building intensity, and land use. The UFEC can provide ecosystem-based information for greening initiatives, tree planting, and the maintenance of the existing canopy. Moreover, its use has the potential to inform the prioritization of limited municipal resources according to ecological conditions and to concerns of social equity in the access to nature and distribution of ecosystem service supply.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Ecosystem classification; Urban forest; Neighbourhood; Management; Cluster analysis\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sabato Vinci, Ioannis Vardopoulos, Luca Salvati,\\r\\n', b'A tale of a shrinking City?

Urbanization without industrialization or, more frequently, a \\xe2\\x80\\x98late and light\\xe2\\x80\\x99 industrialization prevented a specific interpretation of metropolitan dynamics in Mediterranean basin according with the paradigm of \\xe2\\x80\\x98industrial shrinkage\\xe2\\x80\\x99. For the first time in the recent history, the great recession was a factor leading to metropolitan decline in Southern Europe and, after more than one decade, its outcomes can be investigated considering sufficiently long time series of demographic indicators that assess natural population growth and migration rates. Benefiting from quantitative information derived from official statistics, the present study describes medium- and short-term demographic transformations in a large metropolitan region (Attica, Greece) in response to the great recession. After an uninterrupted growth lasting more than one century, the last decade (2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932019) has provided a dynamic representation of regional population decline based on the interplay of long-term factors (aging, low fertility) and concomitant short-term disturbances (counter-urbanization and crisis-driven emigration). By delineating the most relevant socio-demographic mechanisms at the base of recent urban decline, our study contributes to (re)formulate short-term development scenarios in large metropolitan regions, shedding further light on crisis-driven shrinkage in Southern Europe.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Demographic decline; Migration balance; Population age structure; Recession; Urban resilience; Mediterranean Europe\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Irfan Ahmad Rana, Ihtisham Ul Haq Khan Niazi, Zainab Khalid, Adnan Nawaz, Fawad Ahmed Najam,\\r\\n', b'A novel framework to assess multidimensional disaster resilience of children: From conceptualization to quantification,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n', b'Volume 96,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'103914,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103914.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420923003941)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Children are a particularly vulnerable group in disaster situations, yet they are often overlooked in disaster management planning. To address this issue, a multilevel and multidimensional children resilience (MCR) framework is proposed in this study to assess the resilience of children in disaster situations. The framework takes into account four stages and five dimensions of resilience, which represent the layered reality and layered protection experienced by children. The study was conducted in four neighborhoods within the provincial capital of Peshawar, Pakistan. The selected areas exhibited distinctive urban and rural characteristics and were frequently exposed to natural hazards such as floods and earthquakes. The study employed a household questionnaire survey, targeting children as primary respondents. The proposed framework was validated by constructing the Multidimensional Children Disaster (MCR) Resilience Index. The results of the study demonstrate significant variations among all five dimensions of resilience. The proposed framework provides detailed and interactive perspectives on children's disaster resilience, emphasizing that disaster resilience is an integrated approach, which requires an integrated and holistic investigation. The proposed framework and methodology are replicable and can be used to quantify children's resilience and identify specific dimensions that can be enhanced through appropriate disaster risk reduction strategies.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Children disaster risk reduction; Multidimensional children resilience (MCR); Flood; Earthquake; Urban\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Lorena Pasquini, Lisa van Aardenne, Christie Nicole Godsmark, Jessica Lee, Christopher Jack,\\r\\n', b'Emerging climate change-related public health challenges in Africa: A case study of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,\\r\\n', b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n', b'Volume 747,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'141355,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141355.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348841)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Heat has the potential to become one of the most significant public health impacts of climate change in the coming decades. Increases in temperature have been linked to both increasing mortality and morbidity. Cities have been recognized as areas of particular vulnerability to heat's impacts on health, and marginalized groups, such as the poor, appear to have higher heat-related morbidity and mortality. Little research has examined the heat vulnerability of urban informal settlements residents in Africa, even though surface temperatures across Africa are projected to increase at a rate faster than the global average. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through a mixed-methods analysis of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The heat exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of informal settlement residents were assessed through a combination of climate analyses, semi-structured interviews with local government actors and informal settlement residents, unstructured interviews with health sector respondents, a health impacts literature review, and a stakeholder engagement workshop. The results suggest that increasing temperatures due to climate change will likely be a significant risk to human health in Dar es Salaam, even though the city does not reach extreme temperature conditions, because informal settlement residents have high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to heat, and because the heat-health relationship is currently an under-prioritized policy issue. While numerous urban planning approaches can play a key role in increasing the resilience of citizens to heat, Dar es Salaam's past and current growth and development patterns greatly complicate the implementation and enforcement of such approaches. For African cities, the findings highlight an urgent need for more research on the vulnerability and resilience of residents to heat-health impacts, because many African cities are likely to present similar characteristics to those in Dar es Salaam that increase resident's vulnerability.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Heat; Health impacts; Vulnerability; Climate change; Africa\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sunyoung Kim, Jennifer A.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important and often traditional livelihood in the rural global south where income generating alternatives are scarce. Marmato is one of South America's oldest gold mining sites, and ASM has been intermittently practiced there since about 500 B.C. The present study maps ASM onto the five capitals of the SLF and identifies several forms of capitals that miners cited as the most relevant for pursuing ASM activities. The results show that artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Marmato strategically combine different forms of capital that enable them to make a living from mining; however, there are key factors that may impact the longer-term viability of artisanal and small-scale mining livelihoods. Although human, social, and financial capital function to support ASM livelihoods, the finite nature of natural capital and deterioration of physical capital erode the potential for sustainability of those livelihoods. This research highlights the utility of closely examining the capitals in the SLF and suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of ASM capitals can better inform formalization policies and associated development interventions.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Artisanal and small-scale mining; Sustainable livelihoods framework; Formalization; Colombia; Social capital\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Richard Kwabena Nkrumah, Francis Kwaw Andoh, Joshua Sebu, Samuel Kobina Annim, Peter Yeltume Mwinlaaru,\\r\\n', b'COVID-19 water and electricity subsidies in Ghana: How do the poor benefit?,\\r\\n', b'Scientific African,\\r\\n', b'Volume 14,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'e01038,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2468-2276,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2021.e01038.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227621003392)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This paper investigates the extent of welfare distribution amongst households in Ghana due to the government's subsidies on electricity and water as part of its relief package to households on the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to induce policy discussions on effective targeting and the consequential welfare distribution of subsidy interventions in Ghana. Subsidising the price of basic household necessities is expected to immensely benefit the poor whose expenditure is largely occupied by these necessity goods, but, as pertains in developing countries, schemes for effective targeting of the poor are nearly non-existent. This mostly leads to misalignments in income redistribution that is eventually anti-poor. Data from Ghana Living Standard Survey (seventh wave) which captures household final expenditure on goods and services in 2017, including electricity and water, is used for the analysis. First, we simulate household consumption changes as a result of the pandemic on the 2017 data, using on real-time information in the course of the pandemic on household income and expenditure changes. Next, we estimate a complete demand system for all households, and their elasticities of demand for electricity, water and food using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model. Using the computed elasticities, Taylor's approximations are then used to simulate consumer welfare in the form of compensating variation (CV) from price changes due to government subsidies. Our results indicate that the imposed subsidies promote consumer welfare of all households, especially, households living in rural areas. The blanket subsidy on water better identified the poor and the lifeline households than the subsidy on electricity which had a yardstick for targeting. However, we find that the subsidies on the household utilities are regressive in the sense that lifeline consumer households and the poorest households in both urban and rural areas are rather less advantaged in welfare redistribution in both subsidies.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Public health; COVID-19; Welfare; Subsidies; Electricity; Water; Ghana\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Carlos A.

The aim of this paper is to provide a case study on how community participation has proven to be an efficient way of procuring the basic needs of a poor community, such as those involved in providing daily mobility despite the apparent lack of a clear public transport policy. Results indicate that community participation and engagement in a common need can not only provide badly needed means of transportation but also be the impetus to tackle greater transport problems at the policy level. This, as a result, led to better CT which brought about greater accessibility to poor urban neighborhoods and more hands-on government engagement even though it operated only for a short period of time mainly to facilitate the entrance of the public transportation service.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Informal transport; Community participation; Community transport; Social exclusion; Urban accessibility\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ben Brisbois, Katrina Plamondon,\\r\\n', b'The possible worlds of global health research: An ethics-focused discourse analysis,\\r\\n', b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n', b'Volume 196,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 142-149,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.034.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617306998)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Representations of the world enable global health research (GHR), discursively constructing sites in which studies can legitimately take place. Depoliticized portrayals of the global South frequently obscure messy legacies of colonialism and motivate technical responses to health problems with political and economic root causes. Such problematic representations of the world have not yet been rigorously examined in relation to global health ethics, a major site of scholarly effort towards GHR that promotes justice and fairness. We carried out a discourse analysis of four guidance documents relevant to the ethical practice of GHR, purposively selecting texts covering different genres (UN documents and journal articles) and prominent GHR foci (HIV and clinical trials). In light of increasing acknowledgement of the lessons Indigenous health scholarship holds for global health ethics, the four analyzed texts also included a set of principles developed to support Indigenous nation-building. Three of four documents featured global disparities as reasons for ethical caution. These inequalities appeared without explanation or causes, with generation of new scientific knowledge following as a logical response to such disparities. The fourth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Indigenous health-focused \\xe2\\x80\\x93 document clearly identified 'colonialism' as a reason for both inequities in society, and related harmful research practices. Solutions to disparities in this text did not necessarily involve cutting-edge research, but focused instead on empowerment and responsiveness to community priorities and needs. These contrasting representations of the world were accomplished in ways that depended on texts' 'participants', or the people they represented; specific vocabularies or language usages; intertextual relationships to prior texts; and overall objectives or intentions of the author(s). Our results illustrate how ethics and other guidance documents serve as an important terrain for constructing, naturalizing or contesting problematic representations of the world of GHR.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Global health; Ethics; Discourse analysis; Imaginative geographies; Colonialism; Equity; Indigenous\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Vaishali Gijre, Sanjay Gupta,\\r\\n', b'Urban Transport Governance Practice and Challenges in an Emerging Economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Case Study of India,\\r\\n', b'Transportation Research Procedia,\\r\\n', b'Volume 48,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'Pages 2435-2445,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2352-1465,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.293.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146520307134)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: India is witnessing rapid urbanization with 31% of country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population in urban areas which have witnessed a growth rate of 3.16% per annum. Projections (Census 2011) are that by 2031, about 600 million Indians will reside in urban areas, an increase of over 200 million in just 20 years. This Urban India is expected to contribute about 75% to GDP by 2030, up from 63% in 2014. These changes have placed heavy demands on urban transport systems, and to facilitate this, what is required is a sound urban transport policy which can be understood and implemented by officials who are part of the institutional set-up for effective governance. The importance of appropriate transport institutional framework is critical to implementing informed policy decisions. India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urban transport governance currently has fragmented authority, limited institutional support and capacity for creating a transport system that can be leveraged for urban planning, environment, and social goals (including, in particular, limited scope for coordination between land use planning and transport system development), and lack of channels for broad input from local citizens and businesses. This paper attempts to critically analyze the emerging mobility challenges consequent to urbanization pattern in India. It provides an overview of the best urban transport governance practices across the globe and identifies key takeaways in urban transport governance for cities in the developing world such as India for possible adoption.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Transport Governance; Urbanisation; Transport Development\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gerard Bodeker,\\r\\n', b'Health Care of Indigenous Peoples/Nations,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Stella R.

At the same time as representing around 5% of the world's population, indigenous peoples comprise approximately a third of the world's 900million extremely poor rural people. Loss of traditional lands, political and social marginalization, introduction to alcohol and other drugs of addiction, and reduced access to traditional food supplies have resulted in greatly increased susceptibility to disease. Common health risk factors include high tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, poor nutrition, low income, limited education, high unemployment, high levels of stress, social marginalization, inadequate working conditions and housing, and gender-related challenges. Leading communicable diseases include tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, and C, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, malaria, infant diarrhea, and respiratory disease. Successful public health programs are typically based on self-sufficiency, incorporation of traditional cultural practices or practitioners, and equitable partnerships between agencies and indigenous communities.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Aboriginal health; Colonization; Indigenous health; Indigenous peoples; Native peoples; Traditional culture; Traditional medicine\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gizachew Berhanu, Solomon Mulugeta Woldemikael, Ephrem Gebremariam Beyene,\\r\\n', b'The interrelationships of sustainable livelihood capital assets deprivations and asset based social policy interventions: The case of Addis Ababa informal settlement areas, Ethiopia,\\r\\n', b'Research in Globalization,\\r\\n', b'Volume 4,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'100081,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2590-051X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resglo.2022.100081.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590051X22000028)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The purpose of the research is to analyze the pattern of interrelationships in deprivations of sustainable livelihood capital assets, sub-groups deprivation variations in light of the theoretical and empirical frameworks, and suggest recommendations for Asset Based Social policy (ABS). The research reviews the approaches of informal settlement interventions vis-a-vise livelihood capital assets, how livelihood capital assets deprivations affect each other, the relationships of assets and functioning of capability, and the institution role on access and control of assets by vulnerable sub-groups. The case study area was from two informal settlements of Addis Ketema sub-city Wereda 07 (the inner-city slum) and kolfe keranyo sub-city Wereda 03 (peri-urban). The research applied an explanatory mixed-method sequential design consisting of quantitative research based on a house-to-house random sampling survey, followed by the qualitative method of individual case study and key-informants interview. The research refined strategic issues/ indicators that require ABS interventions from the many aspects of deprivations relationships and argued in line with the theoretical and empirical frameworks. The research implicated strengthening institutions to make livelihood capital assets closer to vulnerable sub-groups, especially in peri-urban, empowering community associations bargain for poor rights, reinforce capability functioning for livelihood capital asset accumulation. ABS is crucial for addressing the strategic issue of livelihood capital assets deprivations, tackling institutional and legal constraints, effective functioning of assets and capability, address risk, safety, and vulnerability in informal settlements. The ABS policy improves the wellbeing of poor and vulnerable sub-groups through asset accession, asset valorization, and asset consolidation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Livelihood capital assets deprivations; Asset-Based Social Policy; Sub-groups; Capability; Institution\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ietza Bojorquez, Cecilia Rosales, Alexandra Angulo, Jill de Zapien, Catalina Denman, Hala Madanat,\\r\\n', b'International migration and dietary change in Mexican women from a social practice framework,\\r\\n', b'Appetite,\\r\\n', b'Volume 125,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 72-80,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0195-6663,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.024.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317309571)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Migration from lower- and middle-income to high-income countries is associated with dietary change, and especially with the adoption of a modern, less healthy diet. In this article we analyze the dietary changes experienced by Mexican migrants, employing as a theoretical framework the concept of social practice. According to this framework, practices integrate material elements, meanings and competences that provide their conditions of possibility. Practices are shared by members of social groups, and interact with other competing or reinforcing practices. Between 2014 and 2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 women, international return migrants living in Tijuana, Mexico. The interview guide asked about history of migration and dietary change. We found three main areas of dietary change: from subsistence farming to ready meals, abundance vs. restriction, and adoption of new food items. The first one was associated with changes in food procurement and female work: when moving from rural to urban areas, participants substituted self-produced for purchased food; and as migrant women joined the labor force, consumption of ready meals increased. The second was the result of changes in income: participants of lower socioeconomic position modified the logic of food acquisition from restriction to abundance and back, depending on the available resources. The third change was relatively minor, with occasional consumption of new dishes or food items, and was associated with exposure to different cuisines and with learning how to cook them. Public health efforts to improve the migrants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 diets should take into account the constitutive elements of dietary practices, instead of isolating individuals from their social contexts.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Dietary practices; Dietary change; Migration; Social practice; Mexico; Women\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kevin Fox Gotham,\\r\\n', b'Touristic disaster: Spectacle and recovery in Post-Katrina New Orleans,\\r\\n', b'Geoforum,\\r\\n', b'Volume 86,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 127-135,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0016-7185,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.09.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517302646)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This paper develops the concept touristic disaster asa heuristic device to examine the conflictual and contradictory aspects of showcasing disaster-devastated neighborhoods as tourist attractions.

WAVE was launched in the summer of 2011 to: 1) explore adolescents' perceived health and their top health challenges; and 2) describe the factors that adolescents perceive to be related to their health and health care utilization. Researchers in each site conducted in-depth interviews among adolescents; community mapping and focus groups among adolescents; a Photovoice methodology, in which adolescents were trained in photography and took photos of the meaning of \\xe2\\x80\\x98health\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in their communities; and key informant interviews among adults who work with young people. A total 529 participants from across the sites were included in the analysis. Findings from the study showed that gender played a large role with regards to what adolescents considered as their top health challenges. Among females, sexual and reproductive health problems were primary health challenges, whereas among males, tobacco, drug, and alcohol consumption was of highest concern, which often resulted into acts of violence. Personal safety was also a top concern among males and females from Baltimore and Johannesburg, and among females in New Delhi and Ibadan. Factors perceived to influence health the most were the physical environment, which was characterized by inadequate sanitation and over-crowded buildings, and the social environment, which varied in influence by gender and site. Regardless of the study site, adolescents did not consider physical health as a top priority and very few felt the need to seek health care services. This study highlights the need to focus on underlying structural and social factors for promoting health and well-being among adolescents in disadvantaged urban environments.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban health; Adolescent health; Physical environment; Social environment; Health seeking behaviors; Global health\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Clement J.

A multilevel model is used to analyze survey data of about 90,000 households distributed across 150 towns/tehsils. Empirical estimates show that the vulnerability rate is higher than the rate of poverty, and poverty-induced vulnerability is higher than risk-induced vulnerability. Moreover, idiosyncratic-vulnerability is higher than covariate-vulnerability. Unlike previous studies that find poverty to be a rural phenomenon, this research shows that poverty and vulnerability are equally high in urban areas. A high level of urban vulnerability adds urgency to anti-poverty interventions given a rapid urbanization in Pakistan.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Vulnerability; Multilevel model; Idiosyncratic and covariate shocks; Punjab; Pakistan\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mengbing Du, Mengxue Zhao, Yang Fu,\\r\\n', b'Revisiting urban sustainability from access to jobs: Assessment of economic gain versus loss of social equity,\\r\\n', b'Environmental Impact Assessment Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 85,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'106456,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0195-9255,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106456.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925520301967)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This study has aided an understanding of how the built environment impacts multiple facets of sustainability from perspective of job access that potentially assist in environmental protection, economic development, and social justice. However, the latter two contributions entail tradeoffs that are little-discussed in empirical research. We elaborate upon the manner in which job access affects economic and social sustainability and focus on tradeoffs between the two. We measure and characterize the impact of job access on housing prices and the spatial distribution of disadvantaged populations across New York City, using census data. Results document not only that there are significant positive effects of job access on housing but also that higher housing prices screen out disadvantaged populations and undermine social equity. Findings highlight the paradox in sustainable development that job access seldom exhibits simultaneous positive effects on economic and social equity. We propose that urban built environment might have sigificantimpact on and might be a solution to the tension between economic benefits and social loss regarding job accessibility. That is, appropriate spatial land use planning and public policies could maximize individual welfare and sustainability for future cities-a new perspective of achieving urban sustainability. The major challenge is finding a workable balance between economic and social sustainability that is theoretically sound and empirically feasible.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Job access; Sustainability; Urban built environment; Economic development; Social equity\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kate Bird, Bastien Chab\\xc3\\xa9-Ferret, Alexandre Simons,\\r\\n', b'Linking human capabilities with livelihood strategies to speed poverty reduction: Evidence from Rwanda,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 151,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'105728,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105728.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21003430)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Acute land scarcity in Rwanda limits poor people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to accumulate and move out of poverty. Options for livelihood diversification are restricted by the absence of a vibrant and job-rich non-farm rural economy, and by high rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban inequality which makes the urban economy somewhat inaccessible, particularly given the regulated nature of the urban informal sector, limiting opportunities for migration. Competition for employment is made more challenging by low capabilities, which place high-return jobs beyond reach for many poor people. This paper relies on mixed methods research to explore a land-education-jobs nexus and identify the linked human capital and livelihood determinants of poverty escapes to understand the factors slowing poverty reduction in Rwanda. The quantitative analysis uses three waves of nationally representative panel data between 2010/11 and 2016/17 to investigate correlates of poverty trajectories. The qualitative analysis uses content analysis to explore life histories, focus group discussions and key informant interviews from 14 study sites to explore factors driving change in livelihoods and well-being. Our findings show that the triple challenges of acute land scarcity, low capabilities and a sluggish non-farm economy lock together to form a nexus which limits sustained poverty escapes. In the regression analysis, households headed by primary school graduates are half as likely to be poor as those headed by a primary school dropouts while secondary completion or higher virtually eliminates the risk of poverty. Despite demand, secondary school completion in the fieldwork is beyond the reach of most children from poor households, limiting their later options for livelihood diversification. Near landlessness constrains accumulation and Rwanda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin rural non-farm economy provides few jobs or opportunities for self-employment. Rebooting poverty reduction in Rwanda particularly following the Covid-19 pandemic will require finding ways to sustain poverty escapes through fuelling job-rich \\xe2\\x80\\x98growth from below\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by generating additional demand in the rural economy, continuing to boost agricultural productivity and including even the poorest peasant farmers in that, creating a more conducive business environment for small enterprises and continuing to stimulate investment in job-rich enterprise. Underpinning these strategies should be strengthened efforts to enhance capabilities, education quality, and progression into secondary education.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty dynamics; Education; Land scarcity; Non-farm employment\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'S.

Numerous cities in several developing countries have implemented CDSs. However, in several cases, a mismatch was found between the formulated strategies and CDS implementation. The CDS in Qazvin City was instigated in order to address problems in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urban planning system. As the project progressed, the CDS became the primary mechanism through which the city resolved emergent urban development challenges. In light of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limited experience with CDS implementation, we thought it prudent to investigate the factors that would facilitate successful CDS implementation in the Iranian context. The predictive factors of successful CDS implementation have previously been identified in the CDS literature. We surveyed all participants during the CDS planning process. Local authorities, central government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local experts comprised the pool of respondents. For this study, we employed the partial least squares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 structural equation modeling technique to analyze the data. The results showed a positive relationship between the success factors and the CDS implementation in Qazvin. Consensus building, effective participation, institutionalization, leadership, and capacity building are the determining factors of successful CDS. These factors have a positive and strong effect on CDS implementation. Our findings aid in identifying successful CDS planning system guidelines in the context of Qazvin and Iran.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: City Development Strategy (CDS); Success factors; CDS implementation; Qazvin; Iran\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jorge E.

Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Satellite remote sensing; Urban settings; Regional science applications\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Erick O.

However, most studies have focused on formal settlements. This study deviates from this norm by focusing on informal settlements. Four such settlements in Kisumu, Kenya are analyzed to determine the extent to which water handling hygiene practices constitute a function of CP. Basic 2 by 2 contingency tables and commensurate Chi-square tests are employed. The results, which were statistically significant at p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.01, confirmed the hypotheses. Beneficiaries of water systems involving CP practice better hygiene\\xe2\\x80\\x94e.g., cleaning water storage containers and protecting water sources\\xe2\\x80\\x94than beneficiaries of non-CP systems. Those in the former group reported fewer incidences of waterborne diseases as well as less instances of odor in water than those of the latter. The findings lend credence to a less-known reason for community participation (CP), namely promoting and protecting the hygienic quality of potable water.

In the coming years, it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders. This, however, requires finding viable solutions to a number of complex technical, institutional, and policy issues, including land markets, research on seeds and inputs, agricultural extension, credit, rural infrastructure, connection to markets, rural non-farm employment, trade policy and food price stabilization. This paper reviews what the economic literature has to say on these topics. It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors, the determinants of the Green Revolution and the foundations of agricultural growth, issues of income diversification by farmers, approaches to rural development, and issues of international trade policy and food security, which have been at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in recent years.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Economic development; Agricultural policy; Sustainable development; Rural poverty reduction; Incomes policy and price policy; Agricultural R&D; Technology and extension services\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Hudda Khaleeq Khan, Muhammad Yasir Abdur Rehman, Riffat Naseem Malik,\\r\\n', b'Fate and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in water environment: An insight on their occurrence in South Asia,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Environmental Management,\\r\\n', b'Volume 271,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'111030,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0301-4797,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111030.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479720309580)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Pharmaceutically active compounds are newly recognized micropollutants which are ubiquitous in aquatic environment mainly due to direct discharge of treated and untreated wastewater from wastewater treatment plants. These contaminants have attracted mounted attention due to their toxic effects on aquatic life. They disrupt biological processes in non-target lower organisms upon exposure. Biodegradation, photo-degradation, and sorption are key processes which determine their fate in the environment. A variety of conventional and advanced treatment processes had been extensively investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. However, due to structural complexity and varying operating parameters, complete removal seems ideal. Generally, due to high energy requirement of advanced treatment technology, it is considered cost ineffective. Transport of pharmaceutical compounds occurs via aquatic channels whereas sediments and aquatic colloids play a significant role as sinks for these contaminants. The current review provides a critical understanding of fate and toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds and highlights their vulnerability and occurrence in South Asia. Antibiotics, analgesics, and psychiatric drugs were found predominantly in the water environment of South Asian regions. Despite significant advances in understanding pharmaceuticals fate, toxicity, and associated risks since the 1990s, still substantial data gaps in terms of monitoring, human health risks, and legislation exist which presses the need to develop a more in-depth and interdisciplinary understanding of the subject.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Pharmaceutical compounds; Fate; Toxicity; Risk assessment; Antibiotic resistance; South-Asia\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rongxing Guo,\\r\\n', b'Chapter 8 - Economic Growth and Income (Re)distribution,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Rongxing Guo,\\r\\n', b'Understanding the Chinese Economies,\\r\\n', b'Academic Press,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 125-143,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780123978264,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397826-4.00008-1.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123978264000081)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Justin Stoler, Rawan al Dashti, Francis Anto, Julius N.

Many other febrile illnesses, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, share a similar symptomatology as malaria and are routinely misdiagnosed as such; yet growing evidence suggests that much of the burden of febrile illness is often not attributable to malaria. Dengue fever is one of several viral diseases with symptoms similar to malaria, and the combination of rapid globalization, the long-standing presence of Aedes mosquitoes, case reports from travelers, and recent seroprevalence surveys all implicate West Africa as an emerging front for dengue surveillance and control. This paper integrates recent vector ecology, public health, and clinical medicine literature about dengue in West Africa across community, regional, and global geographic scales. We present a holistic argument for greater attention to dengue fever surveillance in West Africa and renew the call for improving differential diagnosis of febrile illness patients in the region.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Africa; Ghana; Malaria; Dengue; Febrile illness\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Adam Chamberlain,\\r\\n', b'Fusion ballots as a candidate-centered reform: Evidence from Oregon,\\r\\n', b'The Social Science Journal,\\r\\n', b'Volume 49, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 458-464,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0362-3319,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331912000596)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article argues that fusion balloting, or the ability of multiple parties to nominate a single candidate for office, can be viewed as a candidate-centered and incumbent-oriented reform. Using the recent passage of fusion legislation in Oregon in 2009 and its subsequent use in 2010 state legislative elections as a test case, I study the factors behind supporting fusion legislation in both chambers of the state legislature and how these same factors affected, or did not affect, the incumbents that received cross-nominations in the 2010 elections. Overall, I find that party did not play a direct role in determining which legislators supported fusion, though female legislators were less supportive. When it came to obtaining nominations, the main finding is that incumbent candidates who voted yes to fusion were generally more likely to receive nominations. Still, legislators from the group that most opposed fusion, Democratic women, attempted to win cross-nominations once the 2010 elections approached. These findings suggest that candidate factors, more than party dictates, affected support for fusion and the ability of incumbents to receive cross-endorsements. Thus, the willingness of major-party candidates to adopt fusion can be understood through theories of candidate-centered elections and political parties.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: State politics; Third parties; Elections; Fusion; Oregon\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sheela S.

Yet nature-based solutions (NbS) are fundamental to the production of urban resilience. Focusing on Ghana's second largest city, Kumasi, this research (i) examines climate literacy and explores the existing nature-based solutions towards climate change adaption; (ii) examines the perception on existing NbS and the barriers to building climate resilience via NbS; and (iii) explores ways of promoting the implementation of NbS to build climate resilience. It addresses these objectives drawing from secondary data, 367 household surveys and 7 agency interviews. The findings show that about two thirds (63%) of urban residents in the case study area are climate illiterate, and this has affected the slow uptake of nature based solutions as climate management intervention. The urban residents acknowledge the importance of nature based solutions but identify barriers such as poor consideration of the role of natural infrastructure and their incorporation in the planning process, inadequate technical capacity and guidance for incorporating NbS in climate planning, high cost requirements of NbS interventions, disparate interests from various institutions, and a general lack of knowledge, appreciation and interest from urban residents. The study concludes that mainstreaming and upscaling NbS in urban systems will require major investments which should vary from one city to the other depending on perculiar needs.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Adaptation; Resilience; Climate change; Nature-based solutions; Kumasi; Ghana\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Rockli Kim, Sanjay K.

To date, studies have used single-level analyses with aggregated data either at the state level or, less commonly, at the region and district levels. This is the first comprehensive and empirical quantification of the relative importance of multiple geographic levels in shaping poverty distribution in India. We used multilevel logistic models to partition variation in poverty by levels of states, regions, districts, villages, and households. We also mapped the residuals at the state, region and district levels to visualize the geography of poverty. We used data on 35 states, 88 regions, 623 districts, 25,390 villages and 202,250 households from the National Sample Survey in years 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312. Our study found that geography of poverty in India cannot be fully explained by clustered distribution of poor households, and that there may be important contextual factors operating at the state and village levels. We found 13% of the variation in poverty to be attributable to states, 12% to villages, 4% to districts and 3% to regions, after accounting for important household characteristics. Similar variance partitioning was observed for rural and urban sample. The relative importance of one contextual level was highly sensitive to other levels simultaneously considered in the model. Findings from this study suggest that further explorations using multilevel modeling are warranted to identify specific contextual determinants of poverty at the state and village levels to reduce poverty and promote balanced regional development in India.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Asia; India; multilevel; poverty; geography; mapping\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n', b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n', b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n', b'Volume 33,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'100626,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Ferguson deemed that the establishment of separate school systems for whites and blacks did not violate the absolute equality of the two races before the law. Thus, the doctrine of separate but equal prevailed in the provision of public elementary, secondary, and tertiary education in southern states until 13 parents brought a class-action suit against the segregated Topeka, Kansas school district. The landmark decision Brown v. Topeka Board of Education (1954) ruled separate but equal unconstitutional in the case of education, outlawing de jure segregation. Yet, it took a number of years and additional court cases to compel districts to integrate schools and actually dismantle the dual system. Recent Supreme Court decisions do raise the possibility of resegregation going forward, as they narrow the circumstances in which race can be considered in enrolment decisions. In combination with the increasing popularity of various forms of school choice, the changing legal environment will likely erode some of the desegregation gains achieved over the past half century. This article attempts to summarize what we know about the impact of Brown on academic and economic outcomes for blacks. The first section briefly describes the legal history that established the environment governing the allocation of students among schools and the main types of plans used to desegregate schools. The next section documents changes over time in school-enrolment patterns, focusing both on the ways in which districts allocate students among schools and the distribution of students among districts. The penultimate section discusses evidence of desegregation-program effects on white enrolment and the final section discusses the evidence of the effects of school desegregation and racial composition on academic and economic outcomes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Education policy; Peer-racial-composition effects; School desegregation; School quality; Treatment effects; White flight\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Sicheng Wang, Yanfeng Xu,\\r\\n', b'Transit use for single-parent households: Evidence from Maryland,\\r\\n', b'Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,\\r\\n', b'Volume 8,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'100223,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2590-1982,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100223.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301342)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Single parents face unique transportation barriers in their lives. Although helping single parents obtain private vehicles (e.g., car donation programs) would be a potential solution, we cannot ignore the high expense of maintaining and operating a vehicle, which may impose a heavy financial burden on single-parent families and constrain their ability to access opportunities and services. In contrast, public transit could be a more accessible and affordable transportation mode that benefits single-parent families. This study examined the association between public transit use and single parents using 2017 National Household Travel Survey and American Community Survey data for Maryland, United States. Using zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression, we found that single parents used transit more than the average resident, and census block groups with more single-parent families had more transit commuters, holding other demographic and socioeconomic variables constant. This association was more significant in large metropolitan and urban areas than the state average. The findings highlight the vital role of public transit in single parents' daily travel. We discussed policy implications related to helping single parents access opportunities and services.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Single parents; Transit; Transportation equity; Transportation barriers\\r\\n', b'C.P.

More recent concerns have stressed the effective nutritional utilization of that food by individuals, the sustainability of the food systems that produce the food, and the stability of both availability and access, often reflected in the volatility of food prices. Efforts to improve the level of food security are usually measured at the individual or household levels, but important policy issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and political concerns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are also raised at the national level. At a global level, considerable concern exists over the outcome of the race between increases in food supplies and in food demand.

Kunshan, a county in the dynamically growing Yangtze River Delta, serves as a case study to demonstrate how its villages progress in the path of urbanization with the tension between community endeavors managed by the collective and individual pursuits based on bottom-up initiatives. Community-initiated development tends to be socially inclusive to the locals, and there is observed spatial equality between village communities because of equal access to local opportunities. Mutual support within the community or collectivity built upon attachment and affiliation is crucial social capital binding the community together when it undertakes drastic social and economic changes. During the process of rural development, villages try to maintain their collectivity from collective agriculture to collective industrialization and further to collective land shareholding cooperatives in the context of progressive urbanization. Rural villagers are gradually becoming urbanites while remained connected to the village community services.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Collective community; Rural industrialization; Transition; China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Bego\\xc3\\xb1a Guti\\xc3\\xa9rrez-Nieto, Carlos Serrano-Cinca,\\r\\n', b'20 years of research in microfinance: An information management approach,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Information Management,\\r\\n', b'Volume 47,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 183-197,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0268-4012,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026840121830608X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In the last 20 years, microfinance has moved from a promise to reality, although with ups and downs.

Institutionalism, which had little presence in the early research in microfinance, now exhibits great strength. A chronological analysis reveals the evolution of the topics most interesting to researchers: the first stage described the innovations of the microcredit practices and their impact; the second and very expansive stage in which microfinance institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 peculiarities were analyzed; and nowadays the sector is mature but with negative aspects arising, such as mission drift.

In Delhi, villages have been engulfed in the process of urbanisation and rural villages are transformed into urban villages. With the rapid expansion, there has been a significant increase in the number of urban villages. These urban villages are characterized by high growth rate, high density, over population, unplanned buildings and infrastructure shortage. This paper is an outcome of the doctoral research in this topic. The research examines the extent of physical growth and its impact on the increasing disaster risk in the urban villages of Delhi for both plot level and area level. Also it identifies the parameters that were significant contributors to the risk.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Dynamics; Disaster risk; Urban villages; Physical growth\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xiaobo Zhang, Shahidur Rashid, Kaikaus Ahmad, Akhter Ahmed,\\r\\n', b'Escalation of Real Wages in Bangladesh: Is it the Beginning of Structural Transformation?,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 64,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 273-285,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.06.015.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X14001740)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Using data from multiple sources, we show that the real wages in Bangladesh, particularly in rural areas and for female workers, have accelerated in recent years.

From a perspective of environmental equity, we focus on the distribution of four segments of the population\\xe2\\x80\\x94children, seniors, low-income individuals and visible minorities\\xe2\\x80\\x94in noise disturbance zones near major traffic routes of the Montreal Metropolitan Community. First, some corridors along these traffic routes with different levels of noise disturbance are defined according to a number of parameters; subsequently, the overrepresentation of the groups studied is assessed with the help of two indices. Next, we attempt to determine whether these groups have access to noise barriers, abatement measures to mitigate the noise. To assess the overrepresentation of the four groups under examination in protected and unprotected noise disturbance zones, multinomial logistic regression models were constructed for the entire territory, and then for six subregions. The results reveal a situation doubly inequitable for low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, for visible minorities. Indeed, these groups more often live close to major traffic routes and are less likely to be protected by noise barriers. In contrast, children are doubly advantaged.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Bob Rijkers, Rita Costa,\\r\\n', b'Gender and Rural Non-Farm Entrepreneurship,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 40, Issue 12,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 2411-2426,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.05.017.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001398)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Using matched household-enterprise-community datasets from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, this paper analyzes gender differences in rural non-farm entrepreneurship.

Our findings clearly indicate that growth with redistribution (lower income inequality) was the key to reducing poverty continuously and in an important manner during 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932006. However, after 2006, decreasing per-capita income, coupled with the persistently high inequality (Gini of 52%), caused the reversal of the favorable trend observed since 1996, raising poverty to pre-2002 levels. Consequently, it is argued that, for Mexico, a middle-income country exhibiting quite low growth rates and high inequality levels, the further improvement in its distribution of income and assets is essential if the economy is to succeed in making a real dent in poverty. For that purpose, the implementation of an active pro-poor growth policy should be strongly encouraged.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: poverty; inequality; redistribution; pro-poor growth; Mexico; Latin America\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Alessandro Galli, Sara Moreno Pires, Katsunori Iha, Armando Abrunhosa Alves, David Lin, Maria Serena Mancini, Filipe Teles,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable food transition in Portugal: Assessing the Footprint of dietary choices and gaps in national and local food policies,\\r\\n', b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n', b'Volume 749,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'141307,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141307.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348361)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: The food system is increasingly acknowledged as the single largest reason for humans' transgression of key planetary limits and it is gaining centrality in our societal run-up towards a sustainable future, especially at city level. In Portugal, a country characterized by high meat and fish consumption, noticeable food wastage, and high urbanization level, fully understanding and then transforming the food system is of priority. Here we investigate the significance of food in comparison to other daily anthropogenic demands and the current sourcing and resource intensities profiles of dietary patterns at Portuguese national and city level through Ecological Footprint Accounting. A critical assessment of gaps in national and local food policies to trigger a major transformation in the Portuguese food system is also conducted on the basis of a newly proposed analytical framework. Results show that food consumption in Portugal is the single largest reason (\\xe2\\x89\\x8830%) for transgressing the carrying capacity of Earth ecosystems but, despite the urgent need for changes in Portuguese food systems, major deficiencies in local policy implementation exist with weak policy commitment, coordination, and lacking institutional capacity as food policies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially at the local level \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are still not prioritized.

More recent concerns have stressed the effective nutritional utilization of that food by individuals, the sustainability of the food systems that produce the food, and the stability of both availability and access, often reflected in the volatility of food prices. Efforts to improve the level of food security are usually measured at the individual or household levels, but important policy issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and political concerns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are also raised at the national level. At a global level, considerable concern exists over the outcome of the race between increases in food supplies and in food demand.

In this paper, we argue that it is both productive and necessary to examine how climate justice is being pursued at the urban scale, which brings into focus the need for attention to issues of recognition as well as rights and responsibilities. Building on work from environmental justice, which has conceptualized justice as trivalent, we propose that climate justice can be understood as a pyramid, the faces of which are distributions, procedures, rights, responsibilities and recognition. We then apply this conceptual framework to examine climate change interventions in five cities; Bangalore, Monterrey, Hong Kong, Philadelphia and Berlin. Arguing that the politics and practices of urban climate change interventions are constantly engaging with and refracting the idea of justice, we examine how justice was articulated, practiced and contested across our cases. The perspective of recognition emerges as a particularly useful entry point through which to explore the types of rights, responsibilities, distributions and procedures required to respond justly to climate change. We conclude by reflecting on our framework, arguing that it is useful both as an analytical device to interrogate climate justice and to shape the design of climate change interventions which seek to ensure climate justice.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate justice; Climate change; Urban politics; Cities; Justice\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter W.

This rate is higher than in an economy without these externalities. Since measures of private non-market and social benefit externalities are positive, externalities contribute to higher per capita development. The total return is estimated to be considerably higher than the opportunity cost of funds and the return on physical capital, the first major evidence of serious underinvestment in higher education in the US for optimal development.

The chosen methodology credibly controls for the endogeneity of school resources and the results show a persistent positive gap between test scores of urban and rural students. The results of the Oaxaca\\xe2\\x80\\x93Blinder decomposition indicate that the better performance of larger settlements can be primarily explained by the differences in the socio-economic backgrounds of students. The regressions and the decomposition analysis indicate that an increase in school resources has no or only marginally positive impact on individual educational performance. Considering Russia's general demographic decline and the increasingly smaller number of school-aged children, which reduced school and class sizes, particularly in rural settlements, we point out severe inefficiencies plaguing the secondary education system in Russia. Our results also have rather general implications for the analysis of educational policies, which should take into account the evolving characteristics of the population they target.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Education quality; Russia; Urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural divide\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Elia Apostolopoulou, Hitesh Pant,\\r\\n', b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilk Road here we come\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: Infrastructural myths, post-disaster politics, and the shifting urban geographies of Nepal,\\r\\n', b'Political Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 98,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'102704,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0962-6298,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102704.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629822001184)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: In this paper, we explain how China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) drives urban transformation in Nepal reconfiguring geopolitical and geoeconomic relations and remaking the sociopolitical, cultural and material fabric of hitherto peripheral spaces. Given that BRI infrastructures materialize in parallel with Chinese-funded reconstruction projects, we pay attention to the role of post-disaster politics to unravel how ongoing urban transformation does not only affect the present and the future but also people's histories and post-disaster memories by treating places of (re)building as empty of previous life and history. By drawing on 16 months of fieldwork, we show that despite the evident role of the BRI as an agent of urban transformation, the materialization of most BRI projects depends on geopolitical rivalries, negotiations, unstable local coalitions and escalating social contestation. We conclude that in the post-disaster era, BRI projects have become new vehicles towards Naya [new] Nepal, along with many other infrastructural myths that preceded the country's modern history. Nonetheless, the Naya urban Nepal that is emerging from the ruins of the past is contested and uncertain, a far cry from the days of the Panchayat regime and the civil war, when such gargantuan projects were rarely challenged by Nepali people. This is the unique trajectory of Silk Road urbanization in Nepal: an ultimate path to reach a long due rural-to-urban transition that is inextricably linked with decades of infrastructural violence and precarity and strongly shaped by people's struggles against the unequal geographies of BRI-driven urban transformation.\\r\\n\", b'\\n', b'Nauman Ejaz, Thilak Mallawaarachchi,\\r\\n', b'Disparities in economic achievement across the rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban divide in Pakistan: Implications for development planning,\\r\\n', b'Economic Analysis and Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 77,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'Pages 487-512,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0313-5926,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2022.11.023.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0313592622002077)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Growth, underpinned by augmented production, has been the dominant mode of development, where the focus is to influence the ability to increase the output and income of producers. In this process, differences in economic achievement are influenced collectively by geography, culture and institutions that determine effective capabilities. Yet, disparities associated with place are still widespread. In this paper, we draw some insights on the nature of economic deprivation amongst Pakistan households using Household Integrated Economic Survey (PSLM/HIES) data and treating the residential location as a key parameter of interest. In relating to the well-known discussion on rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban divide, we identify some commonalities in location-specific attributes in the achievement of economic-wellbeing. The analyses confirm the existing knowledge that poverty and well-being have strong place attachments, favouring urban areas as locations of greater relative well-being due to low levels of deprivation, in particular health, education and food security. In discussing how location may predispose inhabitants to deprivations or vulnerabilities, we identify some opportunities to realign development focus towards meeting local needs and raising aspirations for self-empowerment by better focusing on the nature of economic linkages that supports livelihood diversity.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Income inequality; Rural transformation; Assets; Wealth; Economic participation; Pakistan\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Raymundo M.

In addition to the perceived level of inequality typically measured in previous studies, we explore perceptions about who is rich and poor and their share of the population. The shape of perceived inequality that we find provides new insights as to why people tolerate large differences between the rich and the poor. We find that Mexicans generally perceive poverty and inequality not too far from measured levels, but they overestimate the income of the rich and their proportion of the population. Their perceptions of social mobility correctly estimate persistence rates at the top and bottom of the distribution, but they overestimate upward and downward mobility. Providing people with more information about observed income inequality and social mobility could be one way to encourage a demand for redistribution. However, randomly providing selected participants with this information has almost zero effect on their desired levels of equality, social mobility, and tax rates. Finally, we find that Mexicans want a progressive tax system in which the poor pay an average tax rate of 14% and the wealthy pay 41%, and that preference for a more progressive tax structure is negatively related to socioeconomic status.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Inequality; Social mobility; Perceptions; Mexico\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mehmet Kalayc\\xc4\\xb1o\\xc4\\x9flu, Sibel Kalayc\\xc4\\xb1o\\xc4\\x9flu, Kezban \\xc3\\x87elik, Ryerson Christie, Maria Evangelina Filippi,\\r\\n', b'An analysis of social vulnerability in a multi-hazard urban context for improving disaster risk reduction policies: The case of Sancaktepe, \\xc4\\xb0stanbul,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n', b'Volume 91,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'103679,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103679.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420923001590)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Despite concerted calls over the past 20 years to ensure that urban development is undertaken in a manner that reduces disaster risk, urban planning often remains myopically focused on the built environment, seeing building codes, and land-use planning, as the most effective mechanisms of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). While these are clearly crucial elements of planning for Tomorrow's Cities, they are only a part of an effective strategy. This article makes the fundamental assertion that DRR policies addressing urban spaces must strive to redress drivers of social vulnerability. This requires an understanding of the complex interactions of forms of marginalization within the local contexts, and how these have been shaped by the broader urban planning and DRR planning environment. A qualitative research method is employed in this study to assist the development of Tomorrow's Cities Decision Support Environment (TCDSE) that facilitates co-production for risk-informed decision-making on future pro-poor urban development in the context of natural hazards. The research study involved semi-structured interviews to obtain an in-depth account of social vulnerability in Sancaktepe, \\xc4\\xb0stanbul. The narratives of the people draw upon different socio-demographic, and socio-economic vulnerabilities besides vulnerabilities due to urban renewal processes which underestimate pro-poor policies in \\xc4\\xb0stanbul. Drawing on the narratives of interviewees, we then highlight the added value of contextualized and (inter)subjective qualitative interpretations. In conclusion, we argue how disaster risk-informed decision-making processes can be more progressive to ensure and serve in reducing vulnerabilities through our qualitative understanding as a voice of the community.

The aim of this study is to measure spatial equity based on spatial proportionalities (SESP), taking into account three-fold factors including service availability, accessibility and mobility. The SESP identifies proportionality between the quality of service distribution and allocating opportunities and the quality of getting access to locations and people's selections according to status quo. Thus, it examines the balance between supply and demand, optimization of distance and the number of choices people make out of total services and the role of move ability to use in compensating for shortages either in terms of service capacity or the level of human deprivation and reduction of effects of distance from services and etc. Gorgan as an old and intermediate city in northern Iran was selected as the case study. The results indicated that the study area does not enjoy suitable proportionality, revealing that the central and northern districts have much more enjoyment than the southern, eastern and western districts. Thus, there is disproportionality between supply and demand, high difference in provided choices and disproportionality between less enjoyed areas and their move ability to use services and inability to create walking travel pattern in Gorgan. Understanding of spatial proportionality can help the planners and policy makers to change their passive role into active in order to reduce inequities, adding to their knowledge on the underlying factors of inequity as well as the factors that hinder and reverse the cycle of inequity.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Spatial proportionality; Spatial equity; Accessibility; Availability; Mobility; SESP method\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Deepty Jain, Geetam Tiwari,\\r\\n', b'Explaining travel behaviour with limited socio-economic data: Case study of Vishakhapatnam, India,\\r\\n', b'Travel Behaviour and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 15,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 44-53,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2214-367X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2018.12.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X18300668)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Travel behaviour varies with respect to the income. Directly reported incomes used in the travel behaviour studies are subject to the issues of under and non-reporting. To account for this, we propose principal component analysis (PCA) on household asset ownership data to estimate socio-economic wellbeing score (SEWS) as the proxy of income. SEWS is used to understand the variation in travel behaviour of people belonging to different income groups in Vishakhapatnam. We have used sample data of 2623 households collected in 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x932013. Internal coherency test and chi-square tests are conducted to assess the robustness of estimated SEWS. Travel behaviour analysis highlights that both the trip length and mode choice significantly varies with regard to the SEWS in Vishakhapatnam. People belonging to the low and low middle SEWS group are more dependent on walking and travel shorter distances as compared to the middle high and very high SEWS group. Encouraging the middle high and very high SEWS group to travel short distances and use low carbon modes of transport will need interventions related to the development control regulations and infrastructure provision. Since SEWS is estimated using multiple variables and captures the consumption pattern of the households, therefore, it can be used as the proxy of income in travel behaviour studies.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Principal component analysis; Asset ownership; Socio-economic wellbeing; Trip length; Modal share\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Gilberto Mahumane, Peter Mulder,\\r\\n', b'Urbanization of energy poverty?

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Luis A.

Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Public transport; Transport subsidies; Job-accessibility; Equity; Palma ratio; Gini index; Bogot\\xc3\\xa1\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Andrew Dustan, Diana K.L.

In contrast, we find little effect on the choices or assignments of low-achievers or those with lower-education parents.

Among the other factors, real wage rate has significant negative effect on employment, whereas that for real per capita developmental capital expenditure, per capita electricity generation capacity and real per capita net state domestic product is significant positive. However, effect of per capita real developmental revenue expenditure is inconclusive. In other words, although it improves employability of workers through their human capital improvement, which is probably met up at the cost of worsening overall infrastructural development, through reducing corresponding capital expenditure!

The paper thus elucidates the effect of two different, yet related social contexts on personal networks: the class context and the national context.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Personal networks; Social support; Community liberated; Context; Inequality; Education\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'R.D.

Most notably, between 2005 and 2013, one-year intercity migration rate for immigrants has decreased by 0.7 percentage-points, compared to a 0.2 percentage-point decline for the U.S.-born population. Literature on urban implications of geographic mobility suggests that consideration of migration trends, or population flows, can improve urban planning, including transportation. Our research focuses on recent immigrants, a group that significantly contributes to public transit ridership in the U.S. In this study, we analyze the influence of the annual average in-migration rate of recent immigrants to various urban areas from within the country on transit ridership changes across the urban areas between 2008 and 2013. We also compare this effect with the effect of annual average in-migration rate of new immigrants to various urban areas from foreign countries. While the average effect of inflow of new foreign migrants on transit demand is suggested in the literature, distinguishing the transit demand of immigrants that are not movers and those that are movers from various locations remains unexplored. We derive migration flows from the American Community Survey microdata, and transit ridership from the U.S. National Transit Database. We perform geospatial analysis to overcome several constraints that make exploration of the migration-transportation connection difficult, particularly the lack of uniformity in geographic boundaries used for data presentation across and within government agencies, and over time. Our results indicate that consideration of domestic in-migration rates of recent immigrants can improve transit demand forecasting. As past literature has found, recent immigrants are highly likely to use transit. Recent immigrant migrants that have arrived directly from another country are even more likely to use transit. Interestingly, recent immigrants that move to a metropolitan area from another location in the U.S. are relatively less likely to use transit. Among domestic migrants, however, those that move to cities undergoing large increase in transit service relative to population are more likely to use transit. High population and transit stop density of both previous and current cities seem to positively affect transit mode choice for commute trips of recent immigrant movers. Declining inter-urban mobility among recent immigrants can indeed alter future transit demand trends. Transit agencies should not treat recent immigrants as a monolithic group. Consideration of the migration patterns of various types of recent immigrants, and factors that determine those patterns, can improve demand forecasting and planning.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Immigrants; Travel demand; Travel behavior; Public transit\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shahidur R.

This approach is applied to cross-sectional data from a comprehensive 2005 household survey representative of both urban and rural India. The objective is to determine if the energy poor are also income poor and whether and how energy policies help reduce energy poverty, independent of income. The findings suggest that in rural areas some 57% of households are energy poor, versus 22% that are income poor. But in urban areas the energy poverty rate is 28% compared to 20% that are income poor. That is, energy policies are expected to play some roles in mitigating energy poverty. We find that reducing energy poverty requires not only support for rural electrification, but also more use of modern cooking fuels such as LPG. While income growth matters, a combination of energy related programs can play an independent and substantial role in reducing energy poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Income poverty; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Vikram Patel, Shekhar Saxena, Crick Lund, Graham Thornicroft, Florence Baingana, Paul Bolton, Dan Chisholm, Pamela Y Collins, Janice L Cooper, Julian Eaton, Helen Herrman, Mohammad M Herzallah, Yueqin Huang, Mark J D Jordans, Arthur Kleinman, Maria Elena Medina-Mora, Ellen Morgan, Unaiza Niaz, Olayinka Omigbodun, Martin Prince, Atif Rahman, Benedetto Saraceno, Bidyut K Sarkar, Mary De Silva, Ilina Singh, Dan J Stein, Charlene Sunkel, J\\xc3\\x9crgen Un\\xc3\\x9ctzer,\\r\\n', b'The Lancet Commission on global mental health and sustainable development,\\r\\n', b'The Lancet,\\r\\n', b'Volume 392, Issue 10157,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1553-1598,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0140-6736,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31612-X.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361831612X)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Marijke Verpoorten, Abhimanyu Arora, Nik Stoop, Johan Swinnen,\\r\\n', b'Self-reported food insecurity in Africa during the food price crisis,\\r\\n', b'Food Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 39,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 51-63,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0306-9192,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.12.006.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919212001315)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article analyzes data on self-reported food insecurity of more than 50,000 individuals in 18 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x932008, when global food prices increased dramatically. The average level of self-reported food insecurity was high but remarkably stable over time, at about 54%. However, this average hides large heterogeneity, both within countries and across countries. In eight of the sample countries, self-reported food security improved, while it worsened in the ten other countries. Our results suggest that heterogeneous effects in self-reported food security are consistent with economic predictions, as they are correlated with economic growth and net food consumption (both at the household and country level). Specifically, in the face of rising food prices, self-reported food security improved on average in rural households, while it worsened in urban households \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a finding that holds when using global prices or domestic food prices. Improvements in food security over time were also positively correlated with net food exports and GDP per capita growth.

It is argued that Mexico City's land-use policy has been reactive and internally inconsistent, failing to take informal settlements into account, has not offered the poor access to housing with adequate services and greater security in terms of land tenure, and lacks the necessary financial resources and institutional capabilities for providing solutions to these problems. Through a case study of informal settlement management policy in the Tlalpan Delegation,11The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelegation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refers to a subdistrict or municipality within the Federal District (D.F.).

Better developmental and health outcomes are strongly associated with family assets, income and education. We introduce a model incorporating a range of theoretical and empirical literature about the relationships between a household's socio-economic position, household interactions, and child educational outcomes. The intention is to illustrate how these frequently cited factors are exacerbated and aligned by stress or difficult environments which cause long-term challenges for children in high-risk circumstances. Finally, we modify the model to illustrate the dynamic nature of these relationships, highlighting how the developmental trajectory of a child who lives with toxic stress might differ from a comparable child with social supports in a situation of low or tolerable stress.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Assets; Children; Education; Risk; Toxic Stress\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Khalid Zaman, Bashir Ahmad Khilji,\\r\\n', b'RETRACTED: The relationship between growth\\xe2\\x80\\x93inequality\\xe2\\x80\\x93poverty triangle and pro-poor growth policies in Pakistan: The twin disappointments,\\r\\n', b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n', b'Volume 30,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 375-393,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.09.023.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312002982)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Population density; Land constraints; Agricultural intensification; Fertility rates; Rural nonfarm economy; Migration\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Raili Nugin,\\r\\n', b\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that they should go.

By looking at media and in-depth interviews with rural youth workers, narratives surrounding young people are examined. These narratives enable rural youth to ground their choices of migration. Rurality is constructed in media through two powerful templates: one of structural marginalization and the other of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpastoral idyll\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based on the stereotypes of nation construction. Youth migration is often explained in media as self-realisation or inevitable moves. Rural youth workers are concerned about young people leaving their home areas, but at the same time they rationalise their leaving by contemporary narratives of self-empowerment and self-expression. Thus, leaving is depicted as moving \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9caway\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In addition, the constantly changing rural context in post-socialist Estonia contributes to a notion of non-fixity in life course decisions and the perception that it is always possible to come back.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Rural youth; Out-migration; Youth transitions; Media discourses; Marginalisation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mylene Lagarde, Duane Blaauw,\\r\\n', b'Pro-social preferences and self-selection into jobs: Evidence from South African nurses,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,\\r\\n', b'Volume 107, Part A,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 136-152,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0167-2681,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2014.09.004.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114002340)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Although a growing body of economic work has looked at the role of pro-social motives to explain self-selection into public or not-for-profit sector jobs, in particular in the delivery of social services, no attention has been given to the role of pro-social preferences in the decision to take up posts in rural and isolated areas. Yet there are reasons to believe that such choices involve a degree of self-sacrifice, in particular in developing countries where rural regions typically combine geographic hostile environment, high levels of poverty, low educational opportunities, limited access to basic services and worse career opportunities. On the other hand, as shortage of qualified staff is higher in rural areas, the returns on the presence of a health worker, and the benefits to the populations, are likely to be higher. Using data from a longitudinal study of nurses in South Africa this paper tests this hypothesis by linking experimental measure of pro-social preferences and revealed preferences outcomes. Three measures of pro-social preferences are constructed based on donations made by study participants in a dictator game played at baseline. Job choices are observed three years later for more than 97% of the initial sample. We show that the more dedicated the nurses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 measured by their generosity towards patients in the dictator game \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the more likely they are to have chosen a rural job. This result is robust to the inclusion of various demographic controls and to different econometric specifications. This finding contributes to the literature on role of pro-social values as an intrinsic motivation factor in labour supply decisions and it has policy implications for the provision of social services in difficult settings.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Public services; Pro-social motives; Self-selection; Rural areas; Nurses; South Africa\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Qiyan Wu, Jianquan Cheng, Guo Chen, Daniel J.

Analyses of diverse data sets at varied spatial scales have supported the development of theoretical frameworks. However, the majority of Chinese case studies published in recent decades were dominantly based on either non-spatial data or population census data at sub-district (or jiedao in Chinese) level. These analyses have been limited through using low-resolution aggregate data resulting in incomplete or biased findings. This paper aims to examine the fine-scale socio-spatial structure of the inner city of Nanjing using the fifth population census data of 2000 at the lowest spatial scale \\xe2\\x80\\x93 community (or juweihui in Chinese) level. Our findings reveal that the policies of the socialist era and the initial outcomes of the introduction of a free market, particularly with regard to the creation of new elite spaces within the inner city, have shaped a complex pattern of socio-spatial differentiation and residential segregation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Socio-spatial differentiation; Residential segregation; Principal component analysis; Community-level; Nanjing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matamyo Simwanda, Yuji Murayama,\\r\\n', b'Spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use change in the rapidly growing city of Lusaka, Zambia: Implications for sustainable urban development,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 39,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 262-274,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.039.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670717309186)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This study examines the spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use (urban-LU) change in the rapidly urbanising city of Lusaka, Zambia, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using geospatial tools and techniques. The results show that the city experienced rapid urban growth, with about a 233% increase in the total urban-LU area from 1990 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 2010. The results also show that urban-LU expansion was more intense during the 2000s than during the 1990s. Spatially, the city displays a disordered pattern of urban-LU associated with the pattern of major roads and the city centre, which draws its legacies from the colonial era. Lusaka has emerged as a highly unplanned city with approximately 40% of the city representing unplanned residential land use dominated by informal settlements (30%). The growth of commercial and industrial land use has also been consistent with high density residential land uses. The growth of planned residential, and public institutions and service land uses has been slow. The results further reveal spatial dependency of informal settlements on commercial and industrial, and planned medium to high density residential land uses. The study discusses and offers vital insights for strategic urban planning that can control the observed unplanned urban growth and stimulate sustainable urban development.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban land use; Unplanned urban development; Intensity and gradient analysis; Spatial dependency modeling; GIS; Lusaka City\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'J.M.

Yields are an object of choice for farmers, so a meaningful interpretation of yield gaps requires giving weight to both the economic and biological realities of crop production. We clarify the terminology surrounding yield gaps, show that closing yield gaps is not necessarily economic, and conclude that food security will be better served by policies that directly enhance the productive capacity of agriculture to supply affordable food efficiently and sustainably.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Crop productivity; Economic efficiency; Food security; Maize; Maximum limiting yield; Measuring yield; Partial factor productivity; Potential yield; Production possibilities; Technical efficiency; Technology; Yield; Yield gap; Yield limit\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jo\\xc3\\xa3o M.

This paper seeks to open up the various fuel-supply strategies that underpin domestic energy use in low-income settings to explain the unconventional solutions (jugaad) that households employ to bridge the gap between energy needs and supply of various fuels, including liquefied petroleum gas. We draw on long-term ethnographic engagements in four severely polluted low-income urban settlements in central India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coal belt to investigate how communities, and primarily women, ensure domestic energy provision. As households struggle to secure a range of potential fuels with different benefits and drawbacks, we outline the socio-cultural and economic processes that shape household energy decision-making. These highly uncertain processes take place within an institutional structure that offers some possibilities, but is overall too rigid to fit the lived realties of low-income residents. Although households commonly understand that there are negative health effects from solid-fuel smoke, pollution and health are only marginal considerations for households facing daily struggles to reduce expenses. We argue that understanding the everyday jugaad of household energy provision is crucial for the possibilities to shift away from fuels damaging to both human health and the environment.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Feminist political ecology; Air pollution; Household fuel; Jugaad; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'C.

On the contrary, less is known about the link between city size and material living conditions. Recently, a strong emphasis has been put on the process of urbanization without growth and on the burst of large cities. The creation of slums and large areas with underdeveloped housing characteristics has become a major concern for urban planners. This is especially the case for developing economies. This work analyses the association between city size and material living conditions in Ecuador, a small developing country experiencing rapid urbanization and where slums constitute a relevant part of the urban landscape. Our findings show that living in denser areas is associated with lower levels of deprivation and overcrowding. Nonetheless, we also show evidence of congestion in larger cities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Deprivation; Developing economies; Ecuador; Slums\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jessica Lin,\\r\\n', b'Affordability and access in focus: Metrics and tools of relative energy vulnerability,\\r\\n', b'The Electricity Journal,\\r\\n', b'Volume 31, Issue 6,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 23-32,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1040-6190,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2018.06.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619018301489)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This work will focus on the consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s household budget to better characterize the vulnerability of low-income communities and the metrics that would be most appropriate to measure the \\xe2\\x80\\x98affordability\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of energy.

Situation analysis of the GBM landscape gives an understanding about the potential prospects and emerging challenges of the region in the face of changing climate and environmental pollution that affects water regime and its quality. This chapter reveals the fact that strategic water management at local, national, and river basin scale can be the driving force to address the emerging challenges common to the region, particularly through river conservation, effective governance, and agreed regional policy to be implemented by the governments of the basin countries. The importance of effective regional cooperation through data sharing, confidence building, and water-sharing treaties in water management for multiple benefit sharing are highlighted toward achieving the peoples' welfare of the greater basin. The river systems are interdependent on one another, and hence, integrated and collaborative policies with investment in adaptive technologies are required for a sustainable solution. This chapter sets objectives to identify and appraise the issues, evaluates problems and prospects for common understanding, and sensitizes the policymakers of the GBM countries on managing water under uncertain climate risks so that water-centered sustainable development through an integrated approach is encouraged in new ways of multiple benefit sharing within the horizon of climate change.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Basin-wide regional cooperation; Climate change; Ganges\\xe2\\x80\\x93Brahmaputra\\xe2\\x80\\x93Meghna Basin; Integrated water management; Transboundary rivers\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'J.

Malnutrition does not always imply hunger or famine and is manifest in many forms, ranging from hunger to obesity. Core factors leading to malnutrition include excessive intakes, insufficient food consumption, and inadequate utilization of nutrients provided by foods ingested. Undernutrition is a term that comprises stunting, underweight, wasting, and deficiency in essential vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients). As such, it is the category of malnutrition that represents nutrient deficits. The other form of malnutrition is associated with excessive energy and nutrient intakes (which may also be accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies or suboptimal intakes), leading to obesity and other diet-related noncommunicable diseases. This article focuses on undernutrition and the challenges countries face in dealing with both undernutrition and overnutrition, in essence, the dilemma of overlapping and coexisting forms of malnutrition.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Development; Malnutrition; Micronutrient deficiency; Severe acute malnutrition; Stunting; Sustainability; Undernourishment; Undernutrition; Wasting\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Masayoshi Okabe,\\r\\n', b'Gender-preferential intergenerational patterns in primary educational attainment: An econometric approach to a case in rural Mindanao, the Philippines,\\r\\n', b'International Journal of Educational Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 46,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 125-142,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0738-0593,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2015.10.006.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059315001285)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: This study investigates the factors determining children's educational attainment, focusing on gender-differential intergenerational patterns, by employing a case study from rural Mindanao. The result mainly shows, unlike general trends in developing countries, educational attainment is more favorable for girls; maternal education level is equally associated with daughters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and sons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 education levels, and paternal education level is preferentially favorable to their sons. To reduce the disparity, suggestions include providing boy-specific interventions to enhance the magnitude of the father\\xe2\\x80\\x93son educational virtuous circle and comparing the magnitude of gender-equal maternal and boy-preferential paternal education influences to specify which effect is larger.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Gender-preferential intergenerational patterns; Elementary education; Delays in schooling; Limited dependent variable regression; Rural Mindanao; The Philippines\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Theodore H.

This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle- and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle- and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems. Health reform is necessarily a continuing process as all countries must adapt to face challenges of cost constraints, inequalities in access to care, aging populations, emergence of new disease conditions and advancing technology including the growing capacity of medicine, public health and health promotion. The growing stress of increasing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, requires nations to modify their health care systems. Learning from the systems developed in different countries helps to learn from the processes of change in other countries.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: National health insurance; national health systems; universal access; global health; health systems in upper; mid level and low income countries; Otto von Bismarck; Nikolai Semashko; William Beveridge; TC (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTommy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Douglas; Lyndon Johnson; Barack Obama; cost constraint; inequalities; health promotion\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Zhihao Zheng, Shida Rastegari Henneberry,\\r\\n', b'Estimating the impacts of rising food prices on nutrient intake in urban China,\\r\\n', b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 23, Issue 4,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1090-1103,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2012.07.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X12000636)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The nutritional impacts of rising food prices on urban households across income classes are assessed using the 2004 NBS urban household survey data for Jiangsu province of China.

This paper explores how entrepreneurship in informal settlements contributes to the co-production of public services. The paper is based on social entrepreneurship frameworks (concerned with infrastructure, environment, housing and technology) that emerged from the literature review, focusing on strategies to solve challenges in informal settlements. The essence of the review was to ascertain the nature of existing and potential entrepreneurial initiatives and the implications for actors, communities, urban governance systems and research. The Campbell collaboration systematic literature review technique was adapted (in a scoping format) as a methodology to screen relevant studies by following the PRISMA Flow statement. The literature review process involved screening 2835 articles from 109 scientific journals published between 2014 and 2022. The outcome of the literature review indicated that current research in this area differed in focus, methodology, and application of theory. It concluded that research that focuses on the contribution of entrepreneurs to the co-production of public services in informal settlements is limited. Using the knowledge that emerged from the literature review, the current study produced an entrepreneurial framework for co-producing public services in informal settlements. It also provided an overview of theoretical and practical knowledge for further research. Future researchers can use the findings of this study to align their research within the interface between entrepreneurship and land management.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Entrepreneurship; Informal settlements; Land; Land governance; Land management; Scoping review\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Brennan Davis, Sonya Grier,\\r\\n', b'A tale of two urbanicities: Adolescent alcohol and cigarette consumption in high and low-poverty urban neighborhoods,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Business Research,\\r\\n', b'Volume 68, Issue 10,\\r\\n', b'2015,\\r\\n', b'Pages 2109-2116,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0148-2963,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.03.009.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014829631500123X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Urbanicity encompasses the different aspects of living in an urban area. While past research treats urban areas as homogeneous, this research employs an empirical study to show how intra-urban differences by poverty are associated with cigarette and alcohol consumption by adolescents. Results demonstrate that for higher poverty adolescents, those living in urban versus less urban areas consume significantly more alcohol and cigarettes. At the same time, for wealthier adolescents, those living in urban versus less urban areas consume significantly fewer of those items. The results are mediated by convenience store density, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between urban environments, specific area characteristics and problem consumption among adolescents. The results suggest that it might be useful to consider new ways of understanding problem consumption by studying distinct aspects of urbanicity related to the retail environment.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Adolescents; Poverty; Cigarette and alcohol consumption; Urbanicity\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Steven Poelhekke,\\r\\n', b'Urban growth and uninsured rural risk: Booming towns in bust times,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Development Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 96, Issue 2,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 461-475,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0304-3878,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.07.007.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387810000866)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Rapid urbanization also happens when economic growth and urban job creation are absent, such as in Africa and Latin America during the eighties.

Slum rehabilitation in Mumbai is a hallmark example of a participatory process which is supposed to improve the quality of life and well-being among the rehabilitated occupants, on paper. Yet our findings show that the key stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (i.e. policymaker, architect, management co-operatives and female occupants) sentiments are worlds apart. This gap evokes a need for a more systematic framework for a participatory approach. Verbal communication has the power to implicitly decipher the common emotion or sentiment regarding infrastructure or its related policy. This study uses a quasi-qualitative approach to understand the underlying concerns of gender mainstreaming in slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) management in Mumbai, India. Verbal narratives from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions are used to explore the concerns of the stakeholders. Sentiment analysis using the machine learning technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to decode the emotions across the stakeholders. The results indicate that gender inequality in SRH is propagated through lack of communication and the different vocabulary used by the female occupants and the apex policymakers. There are also remarkable differences between male- and female-led co-operatives who are in charge of SRH management. Female-led co-operatives were observed to go beyond basic maintenance duties, to reduce debt and monthly fees and to take up incremental improvements such as decorative elements or installation of solar panels. This participation required a full female body co-operative rather than partial female representation in order to be effective. This study suggests that gender mainstreaming is important not only in SRH design but also in maintenance and that exploring the sentiments of the key stakeholders, as proposed in our analysis, could mitigate undesirable effects of SRH and enable the participatory process.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Participatory approach; Gender mainstreaming; Slum rehabilitation; Stakeholders perception; Semantic maps; Sentiment analysis\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Michael Herrmann,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable development, demography and sexual and reproductive health: inseparable linkages and their policy implications,\\r\\n', b'Reproductive Health Matters,\\r\\n', b'Volume 22, Issue 43,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 28-42,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0968-8080,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-8080(14)43757-1.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968808014437571)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The greatest challenge today is to meet the needs of current and future generations, of a large and growing world population, without imposing catastrophic pressures on the natural environment. Meeting this challenge depends on decisive policy changes in three areas: more inclusive economic growth, greener economic growth, and population policies. This article focuses on efforts to address and harness demographic changes for sustainable development, which are largely outside the purview of the current debate. Efforts to this end must be based on the recognition that demographic changes are the cumulative result of individual choices and opportunities, and that demographic changes are best addressed through policies that enlarge these choices and opportunities, with a focus on ensuring unrestricted and universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services, empowering women to fully participate in social, economic and political life, and investing in the education of the younger generation beyond the primary level. The article provides a strong argument for why the Programme of Action that was agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 20 years ago continues to hold important implications and lessons for the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda, which is expected to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\\r\\n', b'R\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\n', b'Le principal enjeu aujourd\\xe2\\x80\\x99hui est de r\\xc3\\xa9pondre aux besoins des g\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9rations actuelles et futures, d\\xe2\\x80\\x99une population mondiale importante et qui s\\xe2\\x80\\x99accro\\xc3\\xaet, sans imposer de pressions catastrophiques sur l\\xe2\\x80\\x99environnement naturel.

By utilising qualitative research methods it highlights the contradictory nature of these meanings: young men are ambivalent toward education when discussing their experiences, yet optimistic when idealising education and imagining their futures. By interpreting these viewpoints through the theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu, I argue that these meanings reflect social, political and economic change in general and contradictions embedded in the education system in particular. While education has historically been used by the Indian middle classes to realise advantage and consolidate privilege, development discourses conceptualise it as a means of achieving social justice and realising equality. Struggles over the meaning education have important social implications for lower middle class young men: although they are excluded from education which they consider to be worthwhile, their discontent is mediated by hegemonic understandings of education. Highlighting these contradictory meanings can be seen as an important contribution to debates about education, development and the Indian middle classes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Education; Neoliberal development; Young men; Bourdieu; Dehradun; Lower middle classes\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kehinde Paul Adeosun, Mary Greene, Peter Oosterveer,\\r\\n', b'Urban daily lives and out-of-home food consumption among the urban poor in Nigeria: A practice-based approach,\\r\\n', b'Sustainable Production and Consumption,\\r\\n', b'Volume 32,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'Pages 479-491,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2352-5509,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.04.024.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550922001129)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Understanding the interaction between urban daily lives and patterns of food consumption in the Global South is important for informing health and sustainability transitions. In recent years, the lives of poor urban dwellers have undergone significant transformations which have been associated with shifts in patterns of daily food consumption from household-based towards primarily out-of-home. However, as of yet, little research has explored how changing everyday contexts of consumers' lives interrelate with their food vending-consumption practices. This study seeks to understand the interrelations between everyday urban lives and out-of-home food consumption practices among the urban poor in Ibadan, Nigeria. A situated social practice approach is employed to understand how everyday contexts shape practices of out-of-home food vending consumption. Multiple methods were employed, including GIS mapping of food vending outlets, quantitative consumer surveys, in-depth consumer interviews, and participant observation. The study provides an overview of food vending-consumption practices in terms of the socio-demographic situation of consumers and the embeddedness of food vending in the practice arrangements making up their daily lives. The findings reveal three key daily life practices that interlock with their ready-to-eat foods consumption practices: daily mobility practices, working arrangements, and domestic engagements These three categories of daily urban practices that have undergone rapid transformation in line with socio-economic change and urbanisation and emerged as particularly important in shaping out-of-home food consumption. The paper concludes by considering the importance of understanding the embeddedness of food vending practices in the daily lives of the urban poor for sustainable food systems transitions in the Global South.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Everyday practices; Food practices; Practice-arrangements; Food vending; Social dynamics; COVID-19; Nigeria\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kidjie Saguin,\\r\\n', b'Why the poor do not benefit from community-driven development: Lessons from participatory budgeting,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 112,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 220-232,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.009.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18303097)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Community-driven development (CDD) has been identified as a potent vehicle for poverty reduction. Over 105 countries have adopted CDD projects in the hope that citizen empowerment translates to socio-economic development. But existing evidence is mixed, with some scholars arguing that CDD does not benefit the poor. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature by identifying any differentiated impact to the poor attributable to a CDD project in the Philippines. It draws on the literature on participatory budgeting to argue that participation of the socially excluded groups like the poor in the collective planning and budgeting determines the extent to which empowerment and democratization can be sustained. Using panel data collected in 2003 and 2010, the paper finds indications of elite control based on a decomposition of the profile of participants of village assemblies, which is a critical participatory institution in providing equal access to all members of the community to the deliberations and negotiations. The average participant of such village assemblies tend to be the less-poor household of the community with the participation of the poor dwindling over the years. The difference-in-difference impact estimation also reveals disappointing results for the poor. Although the project improved average household income among the poor, the project failed to enhance the social outcomes for the poor households such as participation in planning process, trust in the government and solidarity. This study adds to the existing literature showing that CDD may fail to effectively target the poor.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Community-driven development; Participatory budgeting; Impact evaluation; Philippines\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xing Quan Zhang, Michael Ball,\\r\\n', b'Housing the planet: Evolution of global housing policies,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 54, Part 3,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 161-165,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.11.028.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397515302022)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Luke Fesko,\\r\\n', b'First lead, now no bed?

To combat this problem, several states have passed lead abatement laws, forcing landlords to remove lead in the homes they rent if tenants have children under the age of 6. However, these laws have unintended consequences, causing landlords to evict tenants rather than abate lead. I use a difference-in-differences approach while employing various model specifications with various fixed effects and sets of controls to examine the impact of Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2003 lead abatement law on eviction rates. Using newly collected data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, I find that the passage of Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead abatement law sharply increased targeted evictions. Due to the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passage, the average census district in Ohio faced an increased eviction rate of roughly 0.457 points, corresponding to an additional 13.93 evictions a year. These impacts are highly statistically significant, sizeable, and economically meaningful, indicating that policy makers should incorporate distributional consequences when designing future lead abatement laws in order to avoid unintended consequences and ensure equitable outcomes.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Evictions; Lead abatement; Environmental justice\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'C.M.

At the household level urbanisation may drive changes in the allocation of household labour and consequently social and economic relations. Yet how these are manifest in land-based livelihood strategies of arable cropping, livestock husbandry and the collection of wild products in urban settings has rarely been considered. Here we examine the changing participation rates in land-based livelihood activities by male- and female-headed households along the rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban continua of six sub-Saharan African secondary towns. To capture the gendered changes in land-based livelihood strategies along the urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural continuum, 1156 randomly selected households were sampled along transects radiating out from the urban through the periurban to rural surrounds. Participation in different land-based livelihood strategies was recorded by means of a questionnaire. We show that engagement in one or more land-based livelihood activities is widespread (92% of all households), even amongst urban households (82%). We also show that there are marked changes in gendered participation for many land-based activities along the urbanisation gradient, with a general narrowing of differences in participation rates between male- and female-headed households with increasing urbanisation. These results indicate that land-based activities are components of not only rural livelihoods in Africa, but are also practiced by most urban households too, and that urbanisation reshapes some of the gendered dimensions of roles more typical of rural contexts.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Gender; Land; Livelihoods; Livestock; Urban agriculture; Wild resources (NTFPs)\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kacey C.

First, it exhibits the relationship between land and income distribution by developing a theoretical model based on Harris and Todaro (1970) and Lewis (1954). High land inequality increases income Gini coefficients in the urban sector as well as the rural sector, not only by creating congestion in the urban subsistence sector, but also by feeding the growth of the urban reserve army of labor, which pulls down the wages in the urban capitalist sector. Next, the study investigates the empirical relationship between land inequality, level of urbanization and income inequality using cross-country datasets. The estimation results support the theoretical model and indicate that the level of land inequality has a significant impact on determining the level of urbanization, and urban and overall income inequalities. Moreover, the analysis finds that overurbanization increases income inequality. The empirical analysis controls for institutional factors like education inequality and the level of democracy. The results present a stronger evidence on the land inequality\\xe2\\x80\\x99s influence through urbanization than through education and democracy. These results suggest that policymakers should have a broader view as to the importance of agrarian policies. A progressive land reform or/and subsidies protecting small peasantry can also reduce urban income inequality and poverty over the long run.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: distribution; urbanization; informality; economic development\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Natan Waintrub, Margarita Greene, Juan de Dios Ort\\xc3\\xbazar,\\r\\n', b'Designing incentive packages for increased density and social inclusion in the neighbourhood of mass transit stations,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 55,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 133-147,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.03.006.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397516302089)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Local and central authorities have long been interested in taking advantage of investments in mass transit to achieve more sustainable urban development. In the case of Santiago de Chile, a highly income-segregated metropolis that also suffers an increasing urban sprawl, its underground (Metro) and BRT corridor networks offer a unique chance to revert these malaises. In effect, Santiago's modern transit infrastructure is undercapitalized, there are many areas with little or no development in the vicinity of Metro and BRT stations that could be densified providing housing to the growing population, and hopefully even turned into sub centres with urban equipment, servicing the poorer areas, thus diminishing social and spatial segregation. We sought to understand and measure how different government incentive packages could attract private investment into such areas. We used a combination of stated choice and best-worst scaling data to examine the potential power of various government grants to encourage density development, including social integration, at these locations. Our results allowed us to identify a typology of urban areas that respond differently to the incentive packages. The differentiated analysis of the urban areas, their tendencies and perception of potential real estate developers is a significant first step to design ad hoc strategies to encourage sustainable development in the surroundings of Metro and BRT stations.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Densification; Stated choice; Mixed-income housing; Social integration; Incentives packages\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Theodore H.

The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most tragic epidemiologic events since the swine flu in 1917\\xe2\\x80\\x9318 and HIV/AIDS beginning in 1981, both of which killed tens of millions globally. Since the 1870s, life expectancy in industrialized countries has increased steadily, and life expectancy in developing countries has risen dramatically since the 1920s. The spread of public health and medical sciences greatly reduced the massive number of killing and crippling diseases, such as smallpox, malaria, measles, polio, and tuberculosis. Public health has evolved, addressing and shaping an epidemiologic transition in which noncommunicable diseases have become the preeminent cause of illness and death. Since the 1960s, public health and clinical medicine have developed, in tandem, a new transition emphasizing health promotion. This transition has seen dramatic success in improving life expectancy through prevention modalities, including early diagnosis and treatment. The 21st century has seen global health advance through networks of public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private and academic health organizations that have promoted crucial initiatives to expand public health to low- and middle-income countries to improve sanitation, reduce poverty, reduce maternal and child mortality, and control infectious diseases via the Millennium Development Goals to 2015, with commendable participation and success. Those goals were followed by the expanded Sustainable Development Goals to 2030. The first decades of the 21st century have witnessed a series of coronavirus and influenza pandemics. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has cast a pall over global health, with hundreds of millions of cases, millions of deaths, and a stream of viral variants that have swamped control measures. But the future of global health is ripe with positive developments, such as developing new vaccines for Ebola, malaria, and the COVID-19 virus. The evolving New Public Health faces old and new diseases, the challenges of poverty, and the inequities discussed in previous chapters. Global health will need expanded public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private cooperative health networks and initiatives to build on successes and learn from setbacks, including looming climate change, persistent social and health inequity, new global health challenges, and follow-up on many recent achievements.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Control; Disease prevention; Education and health; Elimination; Epidemiologic transition; Global health; Millennium Development Goals; Pandemics; Public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private networking; Reducing poverty and inequity in human rights; Sustainable Development Goals\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Federico Caprotti,\\r\\n', b'Critical research on eco-cities?

Eco-city projects are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and political-economic discourses in a variety of locations as new urban spaces where blueprints for low carbon economies can be trialled. In light of this, the article highlights the key necessity of, firstly, considering scale when analyzing eco-city \\xe2\\x80\\x98futures\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Secondly, the article argues for the need to interrogate eco-cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 definitions, as well as evaluation, performance and monitoring frameworks, as this will aid in critical analyses of the marketing, presentation and actually built urban environments in eco-city projects. Thirdly, the question of internal social resilience and the emergence of communities within newly-built eco-cities needs to be assessed: this is of crucial importance in light of the exclusive, gated nature of several flagship eco-city projects under construction at the time of writing. Lastly, the article argues that research on eco-city projects needs to consider not only the high-tech, new urban environments materialized as eco-cities, but also the production and reproduction of large, often transient populations of low-paid workers who build eco-cities and who form what the article calls the \\xe2\\x80\\x98new urban poor\\xe2\\x80\\x99, forming \\xe2\\x80\\x98workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the edges of flagship \\xe2\\x80\\x98sustainable\\xe2\\x80\\x99 urban projects worldwide.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Eco-city; Sustainable city; Green urbanism; Resilience\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Robert E.B.

Section 2 considers changes in contexts: Where are agricultural research investments most likely to be an engine of poverty reduction? Over the past 25\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears, there have been profound changes in the development context of most countries, necessitating an update on strategic insights for research investment priorities relevant for the economic, political, social, environmental, and structural realities of the early 21st Century. Section 2 briefly surveys changes in these structural aspects of poverty and development processes in low-income countries, with particular attention to new drivers (e.g., urbanization, climate change) that will be of increasing salience in the coming decades. In Section 3, we turn to mechanisms: What are the plausible impact pathways and what evidence exists to test their plausibility? Poor farmers in the developing world are often the stated focus of public sector agricultural research. However, farmers are not the only potential beneficiaries of agricultural research; rural landless laborers, stakeholders along food value chains, and the urban poor can also be major beneficiaries of such research. Thus, there are multiple, interacting pathways through which agricultural research can contribute to reductions in poverty and associated livelihood vulnerabilities. This paper introduces an ex ante set of 18 plausible impact pathways from agricultural research to rural prosperity outcomes, employing bibliometric methods to assess the evidence underpinning causal links. In Section 4, we revisit the concept of desired impacts: When we seek poverty reduction, what does that mean and what measures are needed to demonstrate impact? The papers in this special issue are intended to yield insights to inform improvements in agricultural research that seeks to reduce poverty. History indicates that equity of distribution of gains matters hugely, and thus the questions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho wins?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho loses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must be addressed. Moreover, our understanding(s) of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the intended outcomes of development investments have become much richer over the past 25\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears, incorporating more nuance regarding gender, community differences, and fundamental reconsideration of the meaning of poverty and prosperity that are not captured by simple head count income or even living standard measures.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D); Agri-food systems; Development strategy; Impact pathways; Poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Deborah L.

Previous studies reporting positive associations between child home enrichment and cognitive performance generally had a limited distribution of SES. We evaluated the associations of SES and child enrichment with cognitive performance in a population with a wide range of SES, particularly whether enrichment attenuates associations with SES. Children were sampled from a case\\xe2\\x80\\x93control study of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) conducted in a public hospital serving a low SES population (final n=198) and a private hospital serving a middle-to-high SES population (final n=253). SES (maternal education and income) and perinatal factors (SGA, maternal smoking and drinking) were obtained from maternal birth interview. Five child home enrichment factors (e.g. books in home) and preschool attendance were obtained from follow-up interview at age 4.5 years. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Differential Ability Scales (DAS), a standardized psychometric test administered at follow-up. SES and enrichment scores were created by combining individual factors. Analyses were adjusted for perinatal factors. Children from the public birth hospital had a significantly lower mean DAS general cognitive ability (GCA) score than children born at the private birth hospital (adjusted mean difference \\xe2\\x88\\x9221.4, 95% CI: \\xe2\\x88\\x9224.0, \\xe2\\x88\\x9218.7); this was substantially attenuated by adjustment for individual SES, child enrichment factors, and preschool attendance (adjusted mean difference \\xe2\\x88\\x925.1, 95% CI: \\xe2\\x88\\x929.5, \\xe2\\x88\\x920.7). Individual-level SES score was associated with DAS score, beyond the general SES effect associated with hospital of birth. Adjustment for preschool attendance and home enrichment score attenuated the association between individual SES score and adjusted mean DAS-GCA among children born at both of the hospitals. The effect of being in the lower compared to the middle tertile of SES score was reduced by approximately a quarter; the effect of being in the upper compared to the middle tertile of SES score was reduced by nearly half, but this comparison was possible only for children born at the private hospital. A child's individual SES was associated with cognitive performance within advantaged and disadvantaged populations. Child enrichment was associated with better cognitive performance and attenuated the SES influence. Health care providers should reinforce guidelines for home enrichment and refer children with delays to early intervention and education, particularly children from disadvantaged populations.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Neurodevelopmental; Epidemiology; Sociodemographic determinants; Differential Ability Scales\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Theodore H.

Human resources to provide and manage public health and clinical services are crucial to developing and sustaining national and global health systems. High-income countries are replete with highly trained and motivated personnel, but face issues such as increasing costs of care for aging populations and using new categories of health workers. Low-income countries face severe human resource shortages as training programs are underdeveloped. Health workforce issues include urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural differentiation, promoting standards and quality of care, specialization versus primary care, tensions between public and private health systems, and integrating new health professions. Migration of health professionals from low-income to high-income countries hampers the buildup of a critical mass of leaders, providers, and teachers to expand the capacity of health systems. Strategic policies are crucial to this field.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: community health worker; dental health training; health professional migration; human resources; nurse practitioner; nurse training; paramedical profession; physician training; primary care health provider; public health training\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Alan de Brauw, Valerie Mueller, Hak Lim Lee,\\r\\n', b'The Role of Rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93Urban Migration in the Structural Transformation of Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 63,\\r\\n', b'2014,\\r\\n', b'Pages 33-42,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.10.013.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13002258)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n', b'Rural-to-urban migration is an inherent part of the economic development process, yet it is relatively understudied in sub-Saharan Africa.

Left unaddressed, such stress contributes to burn-out and job turnover, with negative effects on client families as well as agencies and the workers themselves. In response to this problem, some child and family service organizations have encouraged the use of self-care practices to counteract the inherent stresses of these jobs. The present study reports on descriptions of stress and self-care contained in written portfolios of 99 family workers enrolled in a strength-based training program, the Family Development Credential\\xc2\\xae. As found in other research, virtually all study participants reported an over-arching sense of stress and anxiety, with specific issues of workload, client problems, and work/family imbalance most frequently mentioned. To deal with their stress, workers described a variety of self-care practices: most common were mindfulness, exercise, social connections, changing self-expectations, and time management. Results show a significant curvilinear relationship between the number of stresses and the number of self-care practices mentioned, such that workers discussing both the lowest and the highest number of stresses discussed fewer self-care practices than workers naming a moderate number of stresses. Although a similar relationship between the level of stress and individuals' ability to take advantage of available resources has been demonstrated for low-income families, to our knowledge the present study is the first empirical demonstration of this principle for people who serve such families. These findings illustrate the limits of individual self-care for dealing with high levels of stress, and suggest the importance of strengthening worker support at the agency level, as well as tailoring stress management programs to the needs of individual workers.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Family workers; Occupational stress; Self-care practices; Human service agencies\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xiaofen Chen,\\r\\n', b'Why do migrant households consume so little?,\\r\\n', b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n', b'Volume 49,\\r\\n', b'2018,\\r\\n', b'Pages 197-209,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2017.11.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X17301724)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Exploring data from the migrant and urban household surveys of the Chinese Household Income Project, this paper dissects the underlying causes of the depressing effect of the hukou system on migrant household consumption to two channels. On one hand, migrants' disentitlement to local urban hukou creates financial insecurity through barriers to employment, social welfare, medical insurance, etc., thereby encouraging precautionary saving. On the other hand, it promotes temporary migration, allows divergence in tastes and values from local urban residents to persist, and incentivizes migrant households to save their transitory income. Factors reflecting these two channels, such as medical and pension insurances, the duration of migration, and local homeownership, are specifically modeled, and they are found to contribute to the discrepancies in consumption between migrant and local urban households, among other factors. In addition, the marginal propensity to consume exhibits heterogeneity across migrant households; it is higher with a longer duration of migration, local homeownership, and self-employment. The lack of these attributes further reinforces the reluctance of migrant households to consume.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Consumption; Migrant household; Marginal propensity to consume\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Holger Breinlich, Gianmarco I.P.

Timely receipt of transfers yields no expenditure change relative to non-recipients. However, delayed receipt reduces expenditures by 7.5 percentage points. Ignoring heterogeneous timing leads to sizable underestimates of expenditure impacts. After considering several data-driven explanations, we reconcile these findings with models of consumption smoothing in which liquidity constraints imply asymmetric responses to positive and negative shocks. Our results parallel findings on government transfers in rich countries and yield new implications for program evaluation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Cash transfers; Marginal propensity to consume; Liquidity constraints; Program evaluation\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ewa Lechman, Adam Marszk,\\r\\n', b'Chapter Three - The digital revolution for development: Identifying the channels of impact,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Ewa Lechman, Adam Marszk,\\r\\n', b'ICT-Driven Economic and Financial Development,\\r\\n', b'Academic Press,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 53-95,\\r\\n', b'ISBN 9780128137987,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-813798-7.00003-8.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128137987000038)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This chapter profoundly contextualises the emerging interplay between the process of diffusion of ICTs and, broadly defined, shifts in national welfare.

However, this result is potentially hampered by two limitations. First, it may be contingent to the specific choices made regarding the poverty line and the poverty indices used for the analysis. As a consequence, it may collapse if one uses alternative poverty lines or poverty measures. Second, it results from a focus on the sole monetary aspects of poverty. As income does not cover all facets of well-being and since the relationship between these two concepts are quite fuzzy, it may be worth using a broader view of well-being, hence opting for a multidimensional approach of poverty analysis. In the present paper, these two issues are addressed using multidimensional stochastic dominance procedures on the joint distribution of income, education and health in seven Chinese provinces.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: China; Income poverty; Multidimensional poverty; Stochastic dominance tests\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Md.

Abating the issue, current participatory planning and collaborative actions are becoming popular. The major challenge in contemporary pro-poor housing practices is to explore the best practices of community participation, is well-discussed after the withdrawal of government intervention in housing and relying heavily on housing market. This study attempted to explore different forms of community participation to identify options introducing community-led housing in Bangkok and Mumbai for urban poor. The SWOT analyses of the ongoing projects in Bangkok and Mumbai identified scope and operational methodology of community-led housing. Results revealed that different forms of participatory practices are still considering urban poor as beneficiaries in expert-designed pre-determined projects and programmes. Community-led housing process has emerged as a different thought of action which is impulsive, inclusive and initiated by the community. We identified the elements of community-led housing are noticeable through representative networking, collective savings and blended financing, participatory designing, collective ownership, and participatory monitoring and evaluation. Although the community-led housing practice is becoming successful by enabling urban poor in five aspects, yet issue of scaling-up and institutionalization remains unsolved.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Collective savings; Community driven development; Participatory designing; Representative networking; Self-help housing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jan Baedke,\\r\\n', b'The epigenetic landscape in the course of time: Conrad Hal Waddington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s methodological impact on the life sciences,\\r\\n', b'Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 44, Issue 4, Part B,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 756-773,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1369-8486,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.06.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613000897)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: It seems that the reception of Conrad Hal Waddington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work never really gathered speed in mainstream biology.

In particular, it calls attention to the legislative onslaught by city government in the years abutting the 2010 Winter Olympics to cultivate and manage healthy people, communities, and environments. In an effort to sell Vancouver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98liveability\\xe2\\x80\\x99, I argue City of Vancouver endorsed a new legislative alliance that merged a conspicuously Anglo-American wellbeing lexicon, favouring individual responsibility and self-governance, with the performing arts industries. Drawing upon interviews and performance-based research, the paper illustrates how Karen Jamieson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community dance project Connect, created for the In the Heart of the City festival, embodies Vancouver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tri-level legislative ambitions to nurture A Healthy City For All. This materialised through the crafting of a dance-health body practice (healthy people), by choreographing a sense of belonging among \\xe2\\x80\\x98at risk\\xe2\\x80\\x99 communities (healthy communities), and in the uniting of the arts and health professions in the process of \\xe2\\x80\\x98cleaning up\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disenfranchised neighbourhoods (healthy environments). In bringing together scholarship on cultures of wellbeing and creative dance practice, the article contributes to understandings of how the health-seeking subject is embodied and performed. It also offers a productive critique of the exclusionary nature of urban health legislation, and of the contested role artists and arts festivals can play in nurturing urban wellbeing and normalising inequalities.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Creative city; Dance; Health; Governance; Vancouver; Wellbeing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Katherine J.

Using spatial regime and spatial error regression techniques to analyze county census data, we examine spatial differentiation in the relationships that generate child poverty. Our approach addresses the conceptual and technical aspects of spatial inequality. Results show that local-area processes are at play with implications for more nuanced theoretical models and anti-poverty policies that consider systematic differences in factors contributing to child poverty according to the racial/ethnic and economic contexts.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Child poverty; Spatial differentiation; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial regime; Spatial regression; United States\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'J.E.

Although anecdotal evidence suggests that mentoring relationships have the potential to positively influence a range of developmental outcomes, research and evaluation on mentoring has yielded mixed results. In this article, we review the empirical literature on youth mentoring. Although overall effects tend to be modest, the impact of mentoring relationships tends to vary on the basis of the various characteristics of youth, mentors and relationships, as well as the quality and practices of mentoring programs. When mentoring is effective, it is thought to lead to positive academic, behavioral, and psychological outcomes through its influence on adolescents' socioemotional, cognitive, and identity development. Studies have provided preliminary support for these pathways, but additional research is needed to fully understand the underlying processes through which mentoring affects youth development.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Cognitive development; Identity development; Interventions; Prosocial behavior; Relationships; Resilience; Risk factors; Social support; Socioemotional development; Supportive adults; Youth mentoring\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Fernando Puente-Sotomayor, Andrea Egas, Jacques Teller,\\r\\n', b'Land policies for landslide risk reduction in Andean cities,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 107,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'102298,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102298.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397520314223)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Andean cities are increasingly subjected to landslide susceptibility and events, accompanied by population and urban growth and uncertain extreme climate events. In light of this, academic and professional communities have begun to pay close attention and now face the challenge of producing more detailed knowledge and converting it into effective action. This article is based on a literature review supporting a multidimensional conceptual framework to address landslide risk reduction for the urban Andes context. It aims to complement the environmental dimension, which often shows the resulting physical condition of risk, with landslide risk root-causes by exploring socio-economic and socio-cultural dimensions and the policy and institutional apparatuses that accompany the former dimensions. We aim to identify and understand the inextricable links between the four dimensions and determine how subdimensions can operatively describe and help to understand this complexity. An example from a landslide risk-prone site in Quito illustrates the application of the framework and delivers lessons from a specific context and time. Parts of these lessons may be common for other contexts, but their understanding is critical for landslide risk reduction.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Latin America; Risk-sensitive; Land-use; Informality; Vulnerability; Social construction\\r\\n', b'\\r\\n', b'Authors,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Biofuels; Ecosystem services; Biodiversity; Human wellbeing; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Anji Wall, Peter Angelos, Douglas Brown, Ira J.

What policies emerged in the hope of attaining that goal? The last 200 years have witnessed a dramatic change in thinking about poverty. Mainstream economic thinking in the eighteenth century held that poverty was necessary and even desirable for a country's economic success. Today, poverty is more often viewed as a constraint on that success. In short, poverty switched from being seen as a social good to a social bad. This change in thinking, and the accompanying progress in knowledge, has greatly influenced public action, with heightened emphasis on the role of antipoverty policy in sustainable promotion from poverty, as well as protection. Development strategies today typically strive for a virtuous cycle of growth with equity and a range of policy interventions have emerged to help ensure that outcome. An expanding body of knowledge has taught us about how effective those interventions are in specific settings, although many knowledge gaps remain.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Growth; Redistribution; Antipoverty policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'\\r\\n', b'Subject Index,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

Among various available renewable energy sources, India has abundance of bioenergy options that used since long time to meet the cooking and heating requirements. Bioenergy economy is totally dependent on market of supply and demands, interdependent to each other. However, traditional bioenergy applications were found as inefficient practice with harmful environment impacts. Modern bioenergy technologies have potential to fulfill the demand and supply gap of the country. Furthermore, they have high energy efficiency with low carbon emissions. Bioenergy technologies such as biogas, biodiesel, bio-ethanol and biomass gasification having potential for cooking, transport and power generation. Various bioenergy policies and programs have been introduced to accelerate the bioenergy in India in past years. However, country is unable to use adequate available potential of bioenergy options due to policy gaps. Implementation of bioenergy policy is allied with various challenges like technical, institutional, financial, environmental and social aspects. Indian government introduces the new bioenergy policy to accelerate the bioenergy based generation in India. Thus, this article attempts to explore and critically analyze the present bioenergy policies and possible options of recent Indian experiences for successful adoption of bioenergy. A survey based findings is also analyzed through logistic regression and linear regression to explain the pattern of awareness and willingness to pay for bioenergy technology with reference to biogas and improved cookstoves. We found that socio-economic variables are important parameters for the success of bioenergy policies in rural India.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Bioenergy; Bioenergy policy; Biofuel; Biogas; Bio-waste\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): Susan J.

The priorities have changed from a narrow focus on the productivity of food grains to a need for more work on natural resources management and sustainability issues; increasing the productivity and quality of high-value crops, trees, and livestock; agricultural intensification in many less favored areas; more precise targeting of the problems of the poor, including enhancing the micronutrient content of food staples; and analysis of policy and institutional options for achieving more sustainable and pro-poor outcomes in the rural sector. This study draws on the available literature to assess how successful the agricultural R&D system has been in achieving these new goals in South Asia. Overall, it finds that the R&D system has responded well to these changing needs in terms of both budgetary allocations and the kinds of research that has been undertaken. Moreover, market liberalization has enabled a more diverse set of agents to engage in agricultural R&D, and private firms and NGOs have helped ensure that important research and extension needs have not been overlooked. Findings on the impact of this evolving research agenda are mixed. The economic returns to crop improvement research have remained high and well in excess of national discount rates. Public investments in crop improvement research have also given higher returns than most other public investments in rural areas. There is little credible evidence to suggest that these rates of return are declining over time. Agricultural R&D has also made important contributions to reducing poverty in South Asia, but it has done less well in reducing interhousehold and interregional inequities. The greatest impact on poverty has been obtained by lowering food prices, but this pathway might be less important in the future now that food prices are aligned more with border prices and food accounts for a smaller share of consumers' budgets. Also, given that agriculture now plays a relatively small part in the livelihoods of many marginal farmers in South Asia, questions arise about the efficacy of continuing to target agricultural R&D to their problems. Agricultural R&D has also been successful in addressing many of the environmental problems associated with agriculture, with a demonstrated potential for favorable impacts in farmers' fields. Yet the uptake of improved technologies and management practices that reduce environmental damage has been disappointing, particularly in intensively farmed areas. Finally, a large amount of policy research has been undertaken in South Asia since the GR, and case studies show favorable returns to policy research, though the conditions under which it leads to policy change are not well understood.

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mirela Paraschiv,\\r\\n', b'Urban (in) Security and Assessment of Extreme Poverty: Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Perception Referring to Homelessness in Bucharest,\\r\\n', b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 14,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 226-236,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2012.03.022.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612004926)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In the current global economic situation, poverty stands out as a growing concern with multiple territorial aspects. Poverty is to be found both in developing and developed countries with certain differences of classification, typology, magnitude, importance, but nevertheless with some fundamental common characteristics. Homelessness represents the most extreme manifestation of poverty in urban areas. The perception of the community referring to homeless people was evaluated through 150 social surveys among residents in 18 pre-identified areas in Bucharest. Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 security and local reasons of insecurity are used as a perception differentiation instrument in the analysis. Results reflect that homelessness has a high territorial visibility in Bucharest. The phenomenon is recognized as continuously increasing, referring to territorial distribution and affected urban areas, depth and effects on different categories of population and need for more specifically directed policies and action.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; (in) security; extreme poverty; perception; homelessness; Bucharest; Romania\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Brian C.

This paper examines the link between work and poverty in rural America, drawing comparisons over time and in relation to national averages and conditions in urban areas. Using data from the 2001 to 2014 Current Population Surveys, we address three analytic objectives. First, we track changes in the share of poor householders in work, and compare the prevalence of work between the rural and urban poor. Second, we estimate trends in the share of rural and urban workers who are poor, and highlight key social and demographic differentials. Third and finally, we estimate a series of logistic regression models to assess whether and to what extent rural-urban and temporal differences can be explained by the composition of the workforce and changes therein. Results show that an increasing share of the rural poor are out of work, and that the risk of poverty among those who are employed has also increased. While some of the longstanding rural disadvantage appears to have moderated in recent years, these changes are largely due to declining conditions in urban areas. Overall, our results support pessimistic conclusions about the economic status of rural America's workforce, and the ability of rural American's to meet the basic requisites of the good life through work.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Working poor; Rural labor markets; Work; Poverty; Great Recession\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mingxing Chen, Yuwen Sui, Weidong Liu, Hui Liu, Yaohuan Huang,\\r\\n', b'Urbanization patterns and poverty reduction: A new perspective to explore the countries along the Belt and Road,\\r\\n', b'Habitat International,\\r\\n', b'Volume 84,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1-14,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.12.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751830852X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Urbanization and poverty reduction are two vital aspects for global sustainable and healthy development. In the future, the countries along the Belt and Road will play a more important role in global urbanization and poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper aims at elaborating the characteristics and patterns of urbanization and poverty reduction in these countries using data from 1996 to 2016. The results indicate that the average urbanization level is 48% in 2016 and the average annual growth rate of these countries is 0.61 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. In addition, West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have a higher level of urbanization, while ultra-high-speed and high-speed development countries are primarily Southeast Asian countries and China. Furthermore, these countries differentiate significantly in terms of spatial distribution of population density. Regions with a population density of 0\\xe2\\x80\\x931 person per square kilometer account for 33% of the total area and 0.09% of the total population, while regions with a population density of over 1000 people per square kilometer account for 1.45% of the total area and 39.56% of the total population. Moreover, using mathematical morphology methods, we identify the 10 regions with the largest urban land areas among these countries, and seven regions are located in China and Southeast Asia. Finally, the population living in extreme poverty in these countries dropped from 1.17 billion to 355.6 million during the 20-year period, and several countries, such as China, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, have made tremendous progress both in urbanization and poverty reduction. These findings are beneficial for comprehending urban development and poverty reduction in the countries along the Belt and Road as well as for providing references for regional cooperation.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urbanization; Characteristic; Pattern; Poverty reduction; GIS; The Belt and Road\\r\\n', b'John P.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Silvia M.

Starting in the late 1960s with the crisis in Fordism and the closing of factories, a dense population has come to inhabit these urban spaces in the midst of a process of extreme decay.

To analyze poverty and food security in Myanmar during 2020 we surveyed over 2000 households per month from June\\xe2\\x80\\x93December in urban Yangon and the rural dry zone. By June, households had suffered dramatic increases in poverty, but even steeper increases accompanied the rise in COVID-19 cases from September onwards. Increases in poverty were much larger in urban areas, although poverty was always more prevalent in the rural sample. However, urban households were twice as likely to report food insecurity experiences, suggesting rural populations felt less food insecure throughout the crisis.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: COVID19; Macroeconomic crisis; Poverty; Food insecurity; Coping strategies; Social protection\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Clionadh Raleigh,\\r\\n', b'The search for safety: The effects of conflict, poverty and ecological influences on migration in the developing world,\\r\\n', b'Global Environmental Change,\\r\\n', b'Volume 21, Supplement 1,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages S82-S93,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0959-3780,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.08.008.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937801100135X)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: This article discusses how conflict patterns affect the volume, direction and types of migration within the developing world. Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n', b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 132,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'105001,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kwok Yan Chi Jackie,\\r\\n', b'Projecting Sustainable Living Environment for an Ageing Society: The Case of Hong Kong,\\r\\n', b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 17,\\r\\n', b'2013,\\r\\n', b'Pages 675-684,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.084.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029613000868)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: In 2030, 22% of Hong Kong's total population will be aged 60 or older. In order to advocate Active Ageing1 in a qualified and sustainable environment, our research team has continuously investigated the habitable urban living environment for elderly people in Hong Kong. In 2009, we have completed a research on the practice of everyday life of an active group of elderly people. This research aimed to firstly understand how people aged 60 or above live actively in an urban environment; and secondly, to see if they are leading a quality life in Hong Kong. With this conceptual framework in mind, we wished to relate the environmental context to the ageing society. We organized the findings of this research into a conceptual framework to assess the use of urban space in Hong Kong. We wished to find out whether the use of it was fit for providing a qualified life for the older people. We find that while Hong Kong is a liveable city offering a vibrant city life, it is at the same time a \\xe2\\x80\\x98dual city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 where the high spending \\xe2\\x80\\x98nouveau riches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is gradually expelling the poorer citizens not only from the downtown area, but also from maintaining an affordable quality of living. Our findings strongly suggested that ageing is not a barrier to an active social life. In reality, poverty is the major factor that creates both helpless and hopeless feelings among the elderly people. In order to construct a sustainable environment which is \\xe2\\x80\\x98growing old\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the Hong Kong Government should integrate the concern of the older citizens into urban planning and design policies. The most important issue is to make the city life more affordable to all.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Sustainable Living Environment; Ageing society; Active Ageing; Quality of Life; Hong Kong\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shohei Nakamura, Paolo Avner,\\r\\n', b'Spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty: The case of Nairobi,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Housing Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 51,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'101743,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1051-1377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2020.101743.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300796)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The inter-connectedness of workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 residential locations and job opportunities is a key determinant of labor market outcomes. This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n', b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 172,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'106388,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n', b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'John P.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mirela Paraschiv,\\r\\n', b'Urban (in) Security and Assessment of Extreme Poverty: Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Perception Referring to Homelessness in Bucharest,\\r\\n', b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n', b'Volume 14,\\r\\n', b'2012,\\r\\n', b'Pages 226-236,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2012.03.022.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612004926)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In the current global economic situation, poverty stands out as a growing concern with multiple territorial aspects. Poverty is to be found both in developing and developed countries with certain differences of classification, typology, magnitude, importance, but nevertheless with some fundamental common characteristics. Homelessness represents the most extreme manifestation of poverty in urban areas. The perception of the community referring to homeless people was evaluated through 150 social surveys among residents in 18 pre-identified areas in Bucharest. Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 security and local reasons of insecurity are used as a perception differentiation instrument in the analysis.

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Brian C.

This paper examines the link between work and poverty in rural America, drawing comparisons over time and in relation to national averages and conditions in urban areas. Using data from the 2001 to 2014 Current Population Surveys, we address three analytic objectives. First, we track changes in the share of poor householders in work, and compare the prevalence of work between the rural and urban poor. Second, we estimate trends in the share of rural and urban workers who are poor, and highlight key social and demographic differentials. Third and finally, we estimate a series of logistic regression models to assess whether and to what extent rural-urban and temporal differences can be explained by the composition of the workforce and changes therein. Results show that an increasing share of the rural poor are out of work, and that the risk of poverty among those who are employed has also increased. While some of the longstanding rural disadvantage appears to have moderated in recent years, these changes are largely due to declining conditions in urban areas. Overall, our results support pessimistic conclusions about the economic status of rural America's workforce, and the ability of rural American's to meet the basic requisites of the good life through work.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Working poor; Rural labor markets; Work; Poverty; Great Recession\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues.

The unfolding global financial crisis, which brings higher unemployment and underemployment, is likely to further intensify this vulnerability. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban compared with the rural poor to these types of shocks. It reviews some of the unique characteristics of urban life that could make the urban poor particularly susceptible to price and financial shocks and summarizes the evidence regarding the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban poor. The focus is on impacts on poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. The review shows that although the urban poor are clearly one of the population groups most affected by the current (and previous) crises, the rural poor, landless, and net buyers are in no better position to confront the crisis without significant suffering. The poorest of the poor are the ones who will be most affected, irrespective of the continent, country, or urban or rural area where they live. The magnitude and severity of their suffering depends on their ability to adapt and on the specific nature, extent, and duration of the coping strategies they adopt. A better understanding of how these coping strategies are used and staggered is critical to help design triggers for action that can prevent households from moving to more desperate measures. Using these early coping strategies as early warning indicators could help prevent dramatic losses in welfare.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n', b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n', b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 132,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'105001,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Robert MacTavish, Honor Bixby, Alicia Cavanaugh, Samuel Agyei-Mensah, Ayaga Bawah, George Owusu, Majid Ezzati, Raphael Arku, Brian Robinson, Alexandra M.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Florence Dery, Elijah Bisung, Bernard Abudho, Ophelia Soliku, George Dery,\\r\\n', b'Examining the health and wellbeing of women sanitation workers in Ghana and Kenya,\\r\\n', b'Wellbeing, Space and Society,\\r\\n', b'Volume 5,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'100167,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2666-5581,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2023.100167.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666558123000404)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: About 3.6 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed sanitation service. To bridge service gaps, informal sanitation businesses have emerged as alternative service providers to meet the sanitation needs of unserved populations. Informal sanitation workers include persons who empty septic tanks, clean toilets, sewers, and manage public toilets. They provide a fundamental public service particularly in areas where access to municipal sanitation service is limited. Through qualitative methodologies, this paper explores the lived experiences and associated health risks of women working in the informal sanitation sector in urban Ghana and Kenya. Our findings show that female informal sanitation workers were exposed to injuries and infections, stigma and discrimination, emotional and psychological distress, sexual harassment, and unhealthy coping strategies. Distinctively, younger female participants were more likely to experience sexual harassment. Because of social stigma, many of the women developed unsafe work practices such as refusal to wear PPE and working at night. By paying close attention to the embodied effects of informal sanitation work, we can better comprehend the daily politics, lived experiences, and urban social infrastructure regimes that have a significant impact on the quality of life of informal sanitation workers. The results are also crucial for developing programs for women's empowerment and labour and social protection policies, especially in lowincome settings where gender norms interact with income disparities and other sociopolitical issues to affect women's participation in the labor market.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Informal work; Qualitative approach; Sanitation; Health\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n', b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n', b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n', b'Volume 33,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'100626,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Stuart Cameron,\\r\\n', b'Whether and where to enrol?

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Vindya Hewawasam, Kenichi Matsui,\\r\\n', b'Equitable resilience in flood prone urban areas in Sri Lanka: A case study in Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division,\\r\\n', b'Global Environmental Change,\\r\\n', b'Volume 62,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'102091,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0959-3780,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102091.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020303083)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Amid increasing flood incidences and damages in many parts of the world, the fundamental question arises as to the extent to which poor and marginalized residents can manage disasters by receiving equitable, fair and just support. This paper seeks to examine this question by focusing on a poor and vulnerable area of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Administratively this area is called Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD). Here mainly low-income residents live in congested housing conditions with narrow streets and poor drainage management. For years, this Division was regarded as one of the most flood vulnerable areas of Sri Lanka. To understand the resaons, we conducted our field research in this area and interviewed DSD officials and local people with three key equitable resilience dimensions in mind: distributive, procedural and contextual equities. We found that the intensity and frequency of rainfalls had increased in the area, but the residents had not received any flood protection support from the government due largely to some legal and socio-political complications. Many expressed their fear of the next flood incident. As these residents were without legal land ownership the government did not pay much attention to their needs. We also found that a low education level and a lack of political representation led to the marginalization of people in this area. Using information we collected at the Colombo DSD office and other relevant government agencies, we then examine a set of factors that are relevant to income and poverty level, population density, quality of housing, education, infrastructure and participatory decision making. The results show that flood loss and damage risks were heightened by such social vulnerability factors as low income, an unaffordability of flood resilient houses and an absence of policy implementations for flood resilient infrastructure. We also found that a lack of community leadership led to poor participation in decision making. This paper then highlights the important area for mainstreaming equitable community resilience actions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Equitable resilience; Vulnerability; Flood prone urban areas; Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division; Social vulnerability; Equity\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n', b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 172,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'106388,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n', b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 67,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n', b'Dennis R.

Findings have revealed an imbalanced SNAP participation rate among eligible populations in both suburban and rural areas. Studies on SNAP accessibility have often focused on store locations, but few have examined issues of traveling to SNAP offices. In this study, we focused on SNAP office accessibility and its association with rurality. Using Google Map API, we calculated road travel time and distance to the most conveniently located SNAP office for each block group in the conterminous United States. We investigated the degree to which the SNAP office accessibility is linked to rurality, participant demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and the program's overall participation rate. Results showed that at the block-group level, the SNAP-eligible average driving time to the most convenient SNAP office is 15.28\\xc2\\xa0min, while the SNAP-eligible average distance is 8.57 miles. More than 75% of the SNAP-income eligible population lives within a 20-min drive to a SNAP office, and 91.8% lives within 30\\xc2\\xa0min. Every ten percentage points of increase in rurality decreases SNAP office accessibility by one additional minute of car travel time. We designed a Rurality-Travel Clock (RTC) visualization tool to provide a graphic description of the urban-rural setting and SNAP office accessibility. Other observations include a noticeable cross-relationship between population concentration (e.g., white or black) and SNAP office accessibility. The findings help us to understand the dynamic relationships between SNAP participation rate and SNAP accessibility factors, including eligibility, employment status, population, and rurality at the county and state levels.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: SNAP office; Accessibility; Rurality; Poverty\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Cody B.

Research has linked exposure to nature with various benefits including improved focus, vitality, productivity, and reduced stress, factors that may enhance the academic performance of individual students. In intensively-urbanized landscapes with few natural elements this effect could, via aggregated population-level impacts, influence the academic performance of entire populations, negatively affecting educational attainment and propagating urban poverty. Designing urban environments to provide increased interaction with natural landscape elements such as vegetation could mitigate this effect, benefiting the academic growth and future success of urban students. Recent studies support this idea; however, this effect is poorly understood, hindering the management of urban environments to improve educational outcomes. This study explores relationships between urban nature and the academic performance of urban schools using the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA as a case study area. We used regression analysis to identify relationships among environmental variables on and around school campuses (i.e., tree cover, vegetated land covers, water) and four measures of population-level third-grade reading and mathematics success, accounting for school socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Contrary to expectations, we found a positive relationship between impervious surfaces and reading performance, while relationships between two vegetated land covers (grass, shrub) and water bodies and both mathematics and reading academic success were non-significant. We found a significant, positive relationship between tree cover and reading performance, suggesting that initiatives aimed at increasing tree cover in student environments could support academic success.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Green space; Academic performance; Urban environments; Vegetation; School attendance areas\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Michael Poulson, Miriam Y Neufeld, Tracey Dechert, Lisa Allee, Kelly M.

This research finds the positive prospects for low-income neighborhood households to move up, while the characteristics (e.g., racial composition) of origin and destination neighborhoods play a significant role in relocation outcomes. In addition, housing mobility programs can have various impacts on households moving from neighborhoods of different income levels. Policymakers should be aware of the diverse needs of households in extremely low-income neighborhoods (less concentrated housing assistance) and in very low-income neighborhoods (public housing) that can help them move out of concentrated poverty and move up to neighborhoods with higher income spectrums.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Low-income neighborhood; Housing policy; Poverty; Urban governance\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mercedes A.

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Cellular automata; Urban expansion; Global south; Remote sensing; Land cover change; Predictive modelling\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'E.D.

One such inequality is the distribution of urban green spaces (UGS), which are essential to pandemic recovery. Cities that aim to be inclusive and resilient should assess whether access to their UGS is equitably distributed among the population and identify the areas where these spaces are most needed. This study therefore examines the equity of access to UGS in Mexico City at the neighborhood level using network analysis. First, access to UGS was identified at a threshold of 300\\xc2\\xa0m, regardless of UGS size. Second, access was differentiated by the functional level of the UGS, which primarily depends on their size, with larger UGS having more extensive catchment areas. The results of this study suggest a deficit of access to small green spaces in most of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, with the neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty showing an even lower average of UGS access. The results further highlight which neighborhoods in Mexico City should receive priority attention and funding for UGS to mitigate the disproportionate effects of public health crises. This is critical for future city planning and may be used as a roadmap for identifying priority neighborhoods in other cities with similar segregation patterns.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: UGS; Access; Network analysis; Functional levels; Parks\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Joan Rosen Bloch,\\r\\n', b'Using Geographical Information Systems to Explore Disparities in Preterm Birth Rates Among Foreign\\xe2\\x80\\x90born and U.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x90born Black Mothers,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing,\\r\\n', b'Volume 40, Issue 5,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 544-554,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0884-2175,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01273.x.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0884217515305888)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: ABSTRACT\\r\\n', b'Objective\\r\\n', b'To examine spatial patterns of neighborhood contextual factors of stress with preterm birth (PTB) and nativity (foreign\\xe2\\x80\\x90born and U.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x90born) among Black mothers.\\r\\n', b'Design\\r\\n', b'Descriptive geographic\\xe2\\x80\\x90spatial research.\\r\\n', b'Setting & Participants\\r\\n', b'Births to Philadelphia residents during 2003\\xe2\\x80\\x902005 in the context of Philadelphia residential neighborhoods (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0350) were studied.\\r\\n', b'Methods\\r\\n', b'All data were aggregated to neighborhood levels (census tracts).

Early approaches to rural housing were concerned with the connections between housing and poverty amongst agricultural workers and the substandard physical condition of the rural housing stock. With the economic development and population growth witnessed by many rural areas in Western countries during the last three decades, academic attention has shifted to the relations between social change and housing in rural places. Within the recent rural housing literature, important efforts have been made to provide theoretically informed and empirically rich accounts of the production, regulation, and consumption of rural housing. More specifically, attention has been given to three themes: first, the interest and activities of the private capital class, that is, those actors involved in the production and regulation of rural housing; second, the shifting relations between housing, social change, and culture in rural places; and third, the nature and scale of housing needs and homelessness in rural places.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Culture; Housing; Regulation; Rurality; Society; Welfare\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Ronay Thomas, Patrick T.

Socioeconomic challenges have a significant impact on both access and adherence to appropriate treatments which, given a history of racial segregation and discrimination, disproportionately burden under-represented minorities. The distribution of socioeconomic factors, like poverty, educational attainment, and housing quality, can now be assessed routinely at the population level, yet the distribution and impact of such contextual risks in the pediatric sickle cell population have not been sufficiently described. Here, we sought to characterize the burden of neighborhood-level socioeconomic challenges and barriers among children with SCD in one large, urban county. We also sought to determine whether these area-level indicators were associated with hospitalizations and markers of adherence to SCD medications. Methods We pursued a retrospective review of electronic health record data from 2011-2017 for children with HbSS disease in the active Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's SCD registry which includes all children receiving care within the past two years in the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center and is representative of nearly all children with SCD in Hamilton County, Ohio. The analysis was performed under an IRB-approved study investigating socioeconomic factors for children in Hamilton County. Children within the SCD registry were excluded from this analysis if they had a non-HbSS genotype or an address outside of Hamilton County. Addresses were geocoded and linked to a specific census tract which approximates local neighborhood boundaries. Once linked to a census tract, that address was connected to a pre-determined list of variables present within the 2013-2017 US Census' American Community Survey. Variables included the census tract poverty rate, educational attainment rate (percentage of adults with less than a high school education), and the percentage of vacant housing. A validated census tract-level deprivation index, assembled from 6 such census variables, was also included. Outcomes of interest included number of hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period and %HbF for the subset on hydroxyurea treatment. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate ecological socioeconomic characteristics among included patients. Associations between area-based socioeconomic deprivation and outcomes of interest were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Results There were 141 patients with HbSS included in the analysis (53% Male, 82% publicly insured). Mean age at the end of the analysis period was 9.6\\xc2\\xb16.3 years. Consistent with the aggressive treatment strategy at our center, most (97%) were on disease modifying treatment with either hydroxyurea (81%) or chronic transfusion therapy (16%). Compared to the county as a whole, children in the registry mapped to areas with relatively high rates of poverty (median 26%; IQR 15%-42%), low rates of education attainment (median with high school degree 86%; IQR 78%-91%), and high rates of vacant housing (median 13%; IQR 8%-19%). The deprivation index is scaled between 0 and 1 with higher values indicative of more socioeconomic deprivation. In our population, the deprivation index median was 0.45 (IQR 0.36-0.61). When the sample was categorized into three deprivation groups (low < 25th percentile, medium between 25th and 75th, and high >75th percentile), we found trends toward associations with utilization and adherence measures (Table 1). Conclusion A majority of our SCD patients live in neighborhoods with stark socioeconomic challenges and barriers which have been shown to negatively affect health outcomes. There appears to be a significant trend towards increased utilization among those living in more deprived neighborhoods, although, the link with adherence was less clear. The latter finding, indicative of similar HbF levels across deprivation groupings, may be the result of efforts made by our multidisciplinary comprehensive care team to optimize care for all patients regardless of socioeconomic challenges. The data presented here are novel and likely representative of socioeconomic challenges of most SCD patients living in the US. Future, larger, multi-center studies should focus on identifying and addressing social determinants of health within this population. \\r\\n\", b'Disclosures\\r\\n', b'No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'C.M.

This study analyzed blood lead level (BLL) data collected from 2011 to 2016 from approximately 140,000 children ages <1 to 6\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears across South Carolina (SC), including urban and rural areas. Individual-level characteristics included children's age, and race/ethnicity. Block group variables examined included population by race and ethnicity, households below the poverty level, median year homes built, urban/rural classification, and percent road coverage. BLL were higher in urban compared to rural children but increased to a greater extent in rural children from age\\xe2\\x80\\xaf<\\xe2\\x80\\xaf1\\xe2\\x80\\xafyear to 2\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears. Road coverage was strongly associated with higher BLL in urban areas, and with home age more weakly, but neither road coverage nor home age was associated with BLL in rural areas. Young urban children may receive greater exposure to Pb from house dust and outdoor legacy Pb contamination, and young rural children through diet and drinking water. Black children had higher BLL in urban areas than white children, and the converse was true in rural areas. Population data indicated that rural areas had more poverty than urban areas, but strong associations between increased children's BLL and either ethnicity or socio-economic status (SES) at the block group level was not observed, likely due to distinct characteristics of poverty and geographic distribution by ethnicity in urban as compared to rural areas of SC. Individual demographics and environmental characteristics may be more closely associated with BLL than geographically aggregated SES and race/ethnicity characteristics. Interventions to reduce children's exposure to Pb should occur at as early an age as possible, and differences between rural and urban areas should be considered as interventions are developed to reduce children's BLL.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Racial differences; Spatial; Lead exposure; Environmental sources of lead\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Matias Garreton,\\r\\n', b'City profile: Actually existing neoliberalism in Greater Santiago,\\r\\n', b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 65,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 32-50,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.02.005.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275117301932)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: Greater Santiago, the capital of Chile, concentrates most of economic and political power of this nation and 35% of its population. It is a conurbation of 6 million inhabitants, comprising 37 municipalities without a metropolitan level authority, where large scale planning is executed by centralized authorities. The historic development of this metropolis was sharply modified by neoliberal policies that were implemented during Pinochet's dictatorship and by the constitutional definition of a reduced Subsidiary State. These structural reforms had a strong impact on urban development, due to the weakening and incoordination of sectoral planning agencies and the progressive accumulation of socio-spatial inequalities. After the recovery of democracy, a stronger emphasis on social policies was promoted, but public action became increasingly dependent on private providers of public goods. Nevertheless, the early adoption of modern regulations and a sustained period of economic growth have allowed for important advances in quality of life and to considerably reduce poverty levels. This article aims to provide a systemic and critical study of Greater Santiago's institutions, living conditions and the urban outcomes of market-driven planning, considering historical processes and the present contradictions in a partially modern but segregated metropolis. In conclusion, the uniqueness of Greater Santiago's neoliberal development is discussed, highlighting the concentration of power, the influence of capitals over policy design and the strong socio-spatial inequalities that reflect direct wealth circulation from natural resources extraction to financial and real estate rents, in the absence of a strong industrial sector. However, emerging policies and the expected first elected regional governments suggest ways to advance towards more inclusive, participative and intersectoral forms of public action, under the pressure of civil demands for a fairer distribution of wealth, public goods and decision power.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Chile; Urban inequalities; Planning; Housing; Transportation; Privatization\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n', b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n', b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n', b'Volume 67,\\r\\n', b'2017,\\r\\n', b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Michael B.

In the former category are key social agreements, for example, that urban development will be primarily carried out by the private sector, constrained only by planning laws that are mostly in the domain of local and state governments. Examples in the latter category include efforts to solve specific urban problems such as inadequate and unaffordable housing for low-income populations, or to respond to infrastructure deficiencies in transportation. All three countries in North America \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the United States, Canada, and Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are federal in their governance structure, so policy is necessarily distributed across the levels of government. As a result, central government plays only a limited role in key aspects of urban growth, though in Mexico there is a stronger tradition of centralization of policy. Within this framework, urban policy is diverse, but falls into three broad groupings. First, land use and development underpin urbanization; policy in these areas has existed from the earliest days in all three countries, exemplified by regulation of urban form. In North America, such regulation has, to varying degrees, supported market driven development. Second, urban policy deals with management of key functions, exemplified by transportation, public health, utilities, and environmental quality. Such policy occurs at all levels of government. Third, urban policy addresses social issues that have varied over time from the acculturation of immigrants, to poverty, housing, and race relations.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Federalism; Housing; Infrastructure; Land use; Planning; Policy; Poverty; Race; Transportation; Urban\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Khaleeq Lutfi, Mary Jo Trepka, Kristopher P.

A person's community can affect his or her STI risk by the community's underlying prevalence of STIs, sexual networks, and social influences on individual behaviors. Racial residential segregation\\xe2\\x80\\x94the separation of racial groups in a residential context across physical environments\\xe2\\x80\\x94is a community factor that has been associated with negative health outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine if non-Hispanic blacks living in highly segregated areas were more likely to have risky sexual behavior. Demographic and sexual risk behavior data from non-Hispanic blacks aged 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9344 years participating in the National Survey of Family Growth were linked to Core-Based Statistical Area segregation data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Five dimensions measured racial residential segregation, each covering a different concept of spatial variation. Multilevel logistic regressions were performed to test the effect of each dimension on sexual risk behavior controlling for demographics and community poverty. Of the 3643 participants, 588 (14.5%) reported risky sexual behavior as defined as two or more partners in the last 12 months and no consistent condom use. Multilevel analysis results show that racial residential segregation was associated with risky sexual behavior with the association being stronger for the centralization [aOR (95% CI)][2.07 (2.05\\xe2\\x80\\x932.08)] and concentration [2.05 (2.03\\xe2\\x80\\x932.07)] dimensions. This suggests risky sexual behavior is more strongly associated with neighborhoods with high concentrations of non-Hispanic blacks and an accumulation of non-Hispanic blacks in an urban core. Findings suggest racial residential segregation is associated with risky sexual behavior in non-Hispanic blacks 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9344 years of age with magnitudes varying by dimension. Incorporating additional contextual factors may lead to the development of interventions that promote healthier behaviors and lower rates of HIV and other STIs.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Residential segregation; Sexual behavior; NSFG; Census; Non-Hispanic blacks\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Lauren E.

Understanding people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viewpoints on gentrification and vacant lot redevelopment in shrinking cities is important, especially as these perspectives may differ depending on people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s socioeconomic conditions and proximity to these spaces. One common development of vacant lots is into parks. As such, we assessed people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beliefs and attitudes about gentrification, their levels of support of park development in low-income areas, and differences based on presence of vacant lots in their neighborhood, through an online survey of residents in St. Louis, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x94a shrinking city (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0521). We found that respondents valued investments in their neighborhood, including park development. Specifically, respondents supported signs of gentrification from those investments, but also supported preserving neighborhoods\\xe2\\x80\\x94a potentially contradictory viewpoint. When comparing by proximity to vacant lots, we found some differences in respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views. Further, respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 beliefs and attitudes about gentrification influenced their support for different types of development, particularly building parks in formerly vacant lots, if there were not vacant lots present in their neighborhood. Among residents living near vacant lots, beliefs about neighborhood change were unrelated to their attitudes toward gentrification or support of park development\\xe2\\x80\\x94suggesting that abstract beliefs about neighborhood change are not salient to their attitudes and support.

Clusters with less testing and low proportion positive tests had higher income, education, and white population, whereas clusters with high testing rates and high proportion positive tests were disproportionately black and without health insurance. Correlations showed inverse associations of white race, education, and income with proportion positive tests, and positive associations with black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and poverty.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Richard Stansfield,\\r\\n', b'Immigration and Crime in the United States,\\r\\n', b'Editor(s): James D.

The media discussion generated has focused on how to treat illegal immigrants in the country. Missing from public debate on the topic is an examination of what effect immigration has had on American society. To date, scholars have been in agreement that communities within which immigrants have settled are both safer and economically stronger. In large gateway areas, for example, immigration has been associated with lower crime rates, economic revitalization, and reductions in concentrated poverty. While the increase in Hispanic populations cannot be unequivocally tied to these positive trends, immigration has fundamentally changed the character of urban America.

This paper shows that South Africa experienced a reversal of fortunes after the arrival of European settlers in the eastern half of the country. Yet this was not because of an institutional reversal. We argue, instead, that black South Africans found themselves at the mercy of two extractive regimes: one in \\xe2\\x80\\x98white South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and another in the \\xe2\\x80\\x98homelands\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The political and economic institutions of each of those regimes favoured a small elite: in white South Africa, whites, and in the homelands, the black chiefs and headmen. Democracy brought inclusive institutions for black residents in white South Africa but not for those in the former homelands. This is why we see mass migration to the urban areas of South Africa today, and why addressing the institutional weaknesses of the former homelands are key to alleviating the poverty in these regions where a third of South Africans still reside.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Reversal of fortunes; Population persistence; Institutional reversal; Colonial impact; Settler economy; African economic history; Traditional leaders\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n', b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 172,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'106388,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Meme Wang-Schweig, Paul J.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Jason Knight, Russell Weaver, Paula Jones,\\r\\n', b'Walkable and resurgent for whom?

Such calls are often for the kind of high density, mixed-use urbanism that existed prior to the automobile era. Notably, many older industrial cities once exhibited this style of urbanism, and were characterized as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalking cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. More recently, these cities have battled persistent population loss, economic contraction, physical deterioration, and auto-oriented development. As such, their landscapes of walkability may now be fractured or uneven. Moreover, redevelopment efforts that champion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalkability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in such places are regularly targeted toward stable and gentrifying neighborhoods, rather than more distressed areas where resident mobility is comparatively limited. This paper engages with these and related themes for Buffalo, NY\\xe2\\x80\\x94a classic American \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshrinking city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94to understand if/how walkability varies for different socioeconomic and demographic groups. We use WalkScore\\xc2\\xae data measured at the census block group-level to study the geographies of walkability relative to selected socioeconomic attributes. We find that walkable block groups are highly clustered in certain parts of the city, that housing values in walkable areas are increasing, and that individuals in poverty and members of certain minority groups live in block groups with disproportionately low WalkScore\\xc2\\xae. Crucially, the city features several clusters of limited mobility wherein walkability is poor and residents have insufficient access to automobiles. These results suggest that social justice must be a prominent element in urban redevelopment strategies that call for investments into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalkability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Daniel Oviedo Hernandez, Helena Titheridge,\\r\\n', b'Mobilities of the periphery: Informality, access and social exclusion in the urban fringe in Colombia,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 55,\\r\\n', b'2016,\\r\\n', b'Pages 152-164,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.12.004.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692315002380)\\r\\n', b\"Abstract: The relationship between transport, poverty and social exclusion has increasingly held an important place in both research and policy agendas, particularly in industrialised countries. While this has helped consolidate an emerging body of theory concerned with the social consequences of mobility, our understanding of these dynamics in the context of high vulnerability and poverty in the Global South is still relatively undeveloped. Through the case of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Colombia's capital, Bogot\\xc3\\xa1, this paper explores travel strategies in a context of scarce provision of transport which, when combined with acute conditions of low-income and segregation, limit vulnerable populations' access to the city. The travel practices, perceptions and priorities of low-income populations in deprived areas of the Global South are analysed, using a framework of transport-related social exclusion, to critically examine the elements that play a role in gaining access to the city. The emergence of adaptable methods, relations and transactions between demand and supply that allows deprived populations to reduce their risk of becoming socially excluded show potential for conceptual and practical development in addressing and analysing transport-related social exclusion.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Transport; Social exclusion; Urban periphery; Developing countries; Colombia\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Amresh D.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Developing cities; Policies; Poverty; Vulnerability\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n', b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n', b'\\n', b\"Maryia Bakhtsiyarava, Leah H.

In the United States, African American mothers are twice as likely as mothers of other racial and ethnic groups to have a preterm and/or low birth weight infant, the phenomenon of which cannot be explained by maternal and infant characteristics alone. There is increasing evidence that maternal exposure to structural factors that sort African Americans into racially segregated neighborhoods also increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, independent of individual-level differences and area-level poverty. Mothers living in racially segregated urban neighborhoods also experience higher levels and more frequent exposures to crime and environmental contaminants. Stressors associated with the interaction of segregation and poverty (i.e., concentrated poverty) can increase the susceptibility of individuals living in these neighborhoods to the adverse health effects of crime-related stressors and contaminants.

The ability of high quality preconception, prenatal and neonatal-perinatal health care to offset some of the detrimental effects associated with neighborhood risks is also discussed.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Built environment; Infant health; Maternal health; Neighborhood risks; Neonatal-perinatal health care; Preconception health care; Prenatal health care; Racial residential segregation; Teratogens\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Justus Kithiia,\\r\\n', b'Climate change risk responses in East African cities: need, barriers and opportunities,\\r\\n', b'Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,\\r\\n', b'Volume 3, Issue 3,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 176-180,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1877-3435,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.002.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343510001417)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The intensity of future climate change impacts is likely to increase current vulnerabilities and further reduce existing adaptive capacities in major urban areas of East Africa. The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Roberto Cantoni, Federico Caprotti, Jiska de Groot,\\r\\n', b'Solar energy at the peri-urban frontier: An energy justice study of urban peripheries from Burkina Faso and South Africa,\\r\\n', b'Energy Research & Social Science,\\r\\n', b'Volume 94,\\r\\n', b'2022,\\r\\n', b'102884,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2214-6296,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102884.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629622003875)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Most of the global population that lack access to electricity services live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In addition, in those areas where lack of electricity access is common, energy poverty combined with proximity to the grid leads to a greater likelihood of illegal energy supply arrangements. In this fieldwork-based study, conducted through population surveys and interviews in the peripheries of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and Cape Town, South Africa, we employ a hybrid theoretical framework, based on work in urban political ecology and energy justice, to analyze the situation of electricity access in the two areas. We find that the planned scale, scope, and technological design of solar energy projects in peripheral areas are crucial in determining whether and how a project will be beneficial for local communities.

However, socio-spatial factors can limit access to healthcare services, especially for vulnerable populations. This paper aims to quantify the spatial accessibility to healthcare services by public transport across eight major Canadian metropolitan areas and compare accessibility to healthcare across vulnerable population groups. This is the first study, to the authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 knowledge, to conduct an assessment of accessibility to hospitals by public transport across multiple metropolitan regions in Canada, thereby allowing to identify common trends, challenges, as well as knowledge gaps.\\r\\n', b'Methods\\r\\n', b'Spatial accessibility to general medical and surgical hospitals by public transport was measured through a two-step floating catchment area method, considering both service-to-population ratios and travel time to these health services.

This is probably one of the greatest dilemmas in our society, in the globalized world and in regions like Latin America in particular. In the framework of governmentality studies, this paper presents advances in research geared towards characterizing schooling practices in contexts of extreme urban poverty, specifically in an area on the outskirts of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with one of the highest concentrations of shantytowns. Starting in the late 1960s with the crisis in Fordism and the closing of factories, a dense population has come to inhabit these urban spaces in the midst of a process of extreme decay.

An abundance of data at the national and sub-national level is available, but the ability to measure health within urban conurbations has been limited. The deficiency is most evident in the megacities of low and middle income countries (LMICs), whose sprawling slums often lack basic infrastructure\\xe2\\x80\\x94water, sewage disposal, a resilient built environment, transportation. High income counties are deficient as well. Their patchwork of opulence and poverty does not respect traditional administrative jurisdictions and identifying adequate markers of poverty and ill-health is a challenge. Urban metrics have tended to devolve on a set of indicators, often combined using an arbitrary weighting system, that attempt to define the differences within and among urban areas. More recently, general purpose metrics\\xe2\\x80\\x94flexible methods rather than fixed measures\\xe2\\x80\\x94have been adopted to permit local planners and health workers to use local data for small area comparisons. The overall purpose is to use available markers to assess the influence of personal risks and behaviors, the built environment, pollution (air, water, noise, garbage), climate change, and social environment on the level of health within a community and the health disparities among them.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Built environment; Climate change; Determinants; Health; Health disparities; Heat islands; Heterogeneity; Indicators; Metrics; Pollution; Poverty; Slums\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Anand Sahasranaman, Lu\\xc3\\xads M.A. Bettencourt,\\r\\n', b'Life between the city and the village: Scaling analysis of service access in Indian urban slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 142,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'105435,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105435.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21000474)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The emergence of India as an urbanized nation is one of the most significant socioeconomic and political processes of the 21st century. An essential feature of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urbanization has been the growth and persistence of slums in its fast-developing cities. Whether living conditions in Indian slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap to much of their population is therefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we analyse data from the Census of India using the framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative properties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such as access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. We find that slums in larger cities attract more migrants and offer, on average, higher levels of service access than those in smaller cities. We posit that these outcomes are a consequence of both agglomeration effects in larger cities and sub-linear scaling of infrastructure as predicted by urban scaling theory. We also find consistent under-performance in service access in slums, in comparison with non-slum neighborhoods in the same cities. However, urban slums, on average, offer greater access to services than rural areas. This situation, which we quantify systematically, may help explain why larger Indian cities have remained attractive to rural populations in terms of living standards, beyond the need for an economic income premium. Finally, based on the analysis of scaling residuals, we construct a nationwide urban geography of slums, essentially finding that public service delivery in the slums of northern, central, and eastern Indian cities is, on average, poorer than slums in cities of southern and western India. Overall, these findings suggest that urban policy needs to confront two distinct kinds of urban inequity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 across neighbourhoods within cities, and across city scales and levels of development.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: India; Slums; Infrastructure; Scaling; Cities; Service delivery\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Shohei Nakamura, Paolo Avner,\\r\\n', b'Spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty: The case of Nairobi,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Housing Economics,\\r\\n', b'Volume 51,\\r\\n', b'2021,\\r\\n', b'101743,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 1051-1377,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2020.101743.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300796)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: The inter-connectedness of workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 residential locations and job opportunities is a key determinant of labor market outcomes. This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'G.D.

By the same token, in a context of spatially concentrated income-earning opportunities and other urban functions, as well as limited purchasing power, accessibility to adequate means of connectivity with the rest of the urban fabric can be a determining factor in overcoming conditions of poverty for residents in physically marginal areas. Within the framework of the splintering urbanism thesis, and using the case study of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Bogot\\xc3\\xa1, Colombia's capital city, we examine the apparent mismatch between the growth of low-income informal settlements in peripheral locations and the development of transport networks in the period 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932010. Our aim is to identify the effects on social and spatial marginalisation of an uneven provision of material infrastructures and services for mobility. We identify central elements in the structure of the networks of connectivity between Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 and Soacha, highlighting the main gaps that lead to a fragmented set of connections. We develop a set of criteria for planners and policy makers searching for a more informed analysis of transport supply and policy development practice for poor peripheral populations in similar regions and contexts.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Transport networks; Splintering; Inequality; Transport policy\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Dana R.

The WPG-Constrained model, which included building footprint auxiliary datasets, far more accurately estimated the population in all grid cells (including rural areas), and the inclusion of slum training data further improved estimates such that SDG 11.1.1 was estimated at 27.1% and 27.0%, respectively.

In 2012, the Colombian government launched a large-scale social housing program to alleviate the housing deficit caused by conflict and furthermore compensate the IDPs for their losses. The principles of this initiative are in line with the wishes of most victim families, who prefer to stay in the cities to which they moved due to the conflict. The new apartments and houses are provided free of charge and are in high demand. That may help to explain the lack of success of another large-scale reparation program, land restitution, which promotes the return of displaced households to the countryside. Building on empirical qualitative field data, this article shows how the free housing program \\xe2\\x80\\x98cements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the choice of displaced families to continue living in cities and further develop their post-conflict urban livelihoods and social networks, as opposed to returning to the depopulated rural areas and re-establishing agricultural activities.

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Satya Surbhi, Elizabeth A.

The proposed method customization is being employed in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded Management Of Diabetes in Everyday Life (MODEL) study to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect for patient-centered diabetes self-care interventions across the rural-urban spectrum. The proposed suburban/rural vs. urban core classification scheme modification is based on research showing that increasing suburban poverty and rapid conversion of many rural areas into suburban areas in the U.S. has resulted in similar health care access problems in areas designated as rural or suburban.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2The RUCA coding scheme was developed when a much higher percentage of U.S. individuals resided in areas with very low population density.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Using the MODEL study example, this study demonstrates that the RUCA classification scheme using ZIP codes does not reflect real differences in health care access experienced by medically underserved study participants.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Both internal and external validation data suggest that the proposed suburban/rural vs. urban core customization of the RUCA geographic coding scheme better reflects real differences in healthcare access and is better able to assess the differential impact of clinical interventions designed to address geographic differences in access among vulnerable populations.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban-rural classification; Diabetes; Medically underserved populations; Patient-centered outcomes research; Multiple chronic conditions; African American\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'P.

Even though poverty today remains predominantly a rural phenomenon, there is a need to better understand the landscape of poverty in urban areas. Drawing on small-area estimation methods we estimate welfare outcomes at the level of individual towns and cities in Vietnam, including even the smallest towns. Such estimates could not be produced using national sample surveys alone. Results show an inverse relationship between poverty and city size in Vietnam, with the urban poor being disproportionately concentrated in small towns and cities. This relationship is robust to the location of the poverty line as well as to alternative city-size definitions. Interestingly, our evidence of a clear gradient between absolute poverty and city size is not replicated for subjective welfare, measured by self-reported food sufficiency. The absolute poverty-city size gradient does, however, accord with the observation of striking variation in service availability across cities of different size in Vietnam. Small town residents are typically confronted with far lower per-capita availability of basic services than are large city dwellers. The results suggest that policymakers concerned to tackle urban poverty in Vietnam should not neglect attending to smaller towns. Addressing inequalities in access to key basic services across the entire urban population may represent one means to this end.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Subjective welfare; Small area estimation; Vietnam\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n', b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n', b'World Development,\\r\\n', b'Volume 132,\\r\\n', b'2020,\\r\\n', b'105001,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Neil Debbage,\\r\\n', b'Multiscalar spatial analysis of urban flood risk and environmental justice in the Charlanta megaregion, USA,\\r\\n', b'Anthropocene,\\r\\n', b'Volume 28,\\r\\n', b'2019,\\r\\n', b'100226,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 2213-3054,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2019.100226.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305419300372)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Previous research exploring the environmental justice implications of urban flood hazards has produced contrasting results due to the different dasymetric mapping techniques used, the various spatial scales of the analyses, and the specific geographical context of the individual study cities, particularly as it relates to the presence of coastal water-based amenities. To better understand if vulnerable populations are disproportionately exposed to urban flood hazards in non-coastal cities, this study assessed the magnitude of socio-economic inequities in flood risk throughout the Charlanta megaregion. Specifically, population characteristics within the 500-year flood zone were estimated using United States Census Bureau data for race, ethnicity, and poverty by applying three dasymetric mapping techniques at four spatial scales. Risk ratios were used to statistically evaluate if vulnerable populations were overrepresented in areas at risk for flooding overall as well as for lake and non-lake regions. Although the results varied according to the scale and socio-economic variable, the most accurate dasymetric mapping approach indicated that environmental injustices were systemic, as vulnerable individuals were between 14% and 42% more likely to reside in areas at risk for flooding when analyzing the entire megaregion. At the metropolitan scale, vulnerable individuals were still significantly more likely to reside in flood zones, and the influence of lake amenities on the disparities was nuanced. A complex spatial landscape of inequities was also observed at the county and census tract levels. Overall, the notable disparities faced particularly by non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations suggest that urban flood risk inequities in the megaregion are largely due to structural forms of discrimination and residential segregation, which have been pervasive throughout the development of Charlanta.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban flood hazards; Environmental justice; Vulnerability; Charlanta megaregion; Dasymetric mapping\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Anne Doroth\\xc3\\xa9e Slovic, Diego Bogado Tomasiello, Mariana Giannotti, Maria de Fatima Andrade, Adelaide C.

The Municipality of S\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo, one of the world's megacities, reflects this uneven accessibility, marked by urban disparities and segregation of poverty-stricken groups. This study examines the inequalities in job accessibility and how it overlaps with socioeconomic indicators, life expectancy and infrastructure conditions, constituting multiple barriers to the most deprived populations. To capture this data, two extreme ends of the human development index have been selected: below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI). The level of job accessibility was calculated considering proximity to the public transport network. The public transport network was developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) from buses to measure travel times and to compute accessibility. Additionally, a spatial autocorrelation method considering job accessibility and HDI was applied to better explore the spatially overlapped pattern. Results have showed that lower rates of job accessibility are associated with areas of worse socioeconomic condition, where life expectancy is shorter and infrastructure is disproportionally precarious. In addition to facing longer travel times in public transportation, this lowest HDI percentile faces the overlapping inequalities that prevent their social ascension and inclusion. Highlighting these factors is essential in the search for equity in accessibility and the development of more inclusive transport policies.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Transport; Job accessibility; Urban inequity; S\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Hal Pawson, Shanaka Herath,\\r\\n', b'Dissecting and tracking socio-spatial disadvantage in urban Australia,\\r\\n', b'Cities,\\r\\n', b'Volume 44,\\r\\n', b'2015,\\r\\n', b'Pages 73-85,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2015.02.001.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275115000165)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Despite over 20years of uninterrupted economic growth and population expansion, distinct concentrations of poverty and disadvantage remain extant in all Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major conurbations.

Urban agriculture (UA) has gained a prominent role in urban greening and food system diversification strategies alike. Despite that it is the preeminent form of food production in North American cities, residential gardening has received little scholarly attention. Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Equity; Food systems planning; Gardens; Mixed-methods; Sustainability; Urban agriculture\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kelly M.

Asthma is currently one of the most prevalent chronic childhood diseases. Over the past three decades, the greatest increases in asthma rates have been in urban areas and have disproportionately affected youth in poverty and those in racial and ethnic minority groups. Neighborhoods serve as a mechanism fostering environmental injustice and perpetuating these disparities in health outcomes and life opportunity for our most vulnerable populations. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods in a case study of St. Louis Missouri, this study examines local environmental risk by identifying \\xe2\\x80\\x98hotspots,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or statistically significant spatial clustering of high or low levels of childhood asthma, and associations with neighborhood characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, and access to healthcare resources within these hotspots. Results revealed statistically significant clustering of high asthma rates in areas with more non-White and poor residents, higher rates of public housing, deteriorating housing, and violent crime. High asthma hotspots were also located in areas with limited physical access to healthcare resources, such as physicians and medication, and lower school attendance rates. Residents of these high asthma hotspots experience greater environmental risk, and significant disparities in health and education outcomes, physical and financial healthcare resources, and overall well-being. This study demonstrates these place-based inequalities and presents clear evidence of environmental injustice, supporting the need for investments and interventions to improve the environments, health, and economic resources of our most vulnerable youth.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Asthma; Health disparities; Environmental injustice; Geospatial analysis; Segregation; Education; Healthcare access; Housing\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Kevin A.

The study included 161,619 women 40+ years old diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 -2006 in ten participating US states. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis for the entire study population and by state. Poverty was independently associated with late-stage in the overall population (poverty rates >20% OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.26- 1.35) and for 9 of the 10 states. Geographic access was not associated with late-stage diagnosis after adjusting for CT poverty. State-specific analysis provided little evidence that geographic access was associated with breast cancer stage at diagnosis, and after adjusting for poverty, geographic access mattered in only 1 state. Overall, compared to women with private insurance, the adjusted odds ratios for late stage at diagnosis among women with either no insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare were 1.80 (95% CI = 1.65, 1.96), 1.75 (95% CI = 1.68, 1.84), and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01, 1.08), respectively. Although geographic access to mammography was not a significant predictor of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis, women in high poverty areas or uninsured are at greatest risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer regardless of geographic location and may benefit from targeted interventions.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Breast cancer; Access to care; Cancer stage at diagnosis; Cancer survival; Urban/rural\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Anna G.

In the United States, it was legal and widely practiced well into the 1960s and has persisted in varying forms since. The Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) was one of many institutions engaging in racially discriminatory practices and created neighborhood appraisal maps in the 1930s based in part on race, ethnicity, and economic class of a neighborhood's residents. Using these HOLC neighborhood boundaries, we compared 12 present day population characteristics including health, employment, education, and income measures in each of the four HOLC neighborhood ratings across 14 U.S. cities. We used population-weighted logistic regression for paired data comparison and unsupervised learning techniques to uncover the consistency between HOLC evaluations and today's socio-economic and health outcomes. While existing literature focuses on case studies of particular cities and outcomes, we took a broad view and found consistent relationships over our study's cities and variables with few exceptions. Though there are many factors that contribute to continued inequality in a particular area, this study demonstrates that socio-economic and health inequality measured across numerous indicators continues to align with historic discriminatory housing boundaries.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Redlining; Environmental justice; Urban inequality\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'M.

The provision of equal opportunities is becoming increasingly difficult due to urbanization. Most studies examined the inequality in context with social indicators and few empirical studies focused on the distribution of opportunities in the form of opportunity indices. This study aims to examine the spatial distribution of public facilities in 36 districts of Punjab province, Pakistan. We develop a composite opportunity index from various social indicators retrieved from household surveys. Using global and local Moran's indices, we analyzed the social indicators along three lines, i.e., health, education, and civic facilities. We investigated inequalities in opportunities through its various factors derived from NOAA nighttime light data and other global data sets. Results reveal that the allocation of facilities is clustered in north and north-eastern regions of Punjab while southern areas are having large inequality of opportunities in accessing basic services. The inequalities are driven particularly in terms of poverty, road accessibility, and urban infrastructure depicted through nighttime data, while it is not driven by population. The evidence-based method in this research will help implicate policies through prioritizing resource allocation in terms of space and equal opportunities.\\r\\n\", b'Keywords: Urban sustainability; Social exclusion; Composite opportunity index; NOAA NTL; Spatial mapping; Geographical weighted regression\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Stuart Cameron,\\r\\n', b'Whether and where to enrol?

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Tony G.

Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O3 and PM2.5).\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Karen Lucas,\\r\\n', b'Making the connections between transport disadvantage and the social exclusion of low income populations in the Tshwane Region of South Africa,\\r\\n', b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n', b'Volume 19, Issue 6,\\r\\n', b'2011,\\r\\n', b'Pages 1320-1334,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.02.007.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692311000196)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: To date, the majority of studies which consider transport from a social exclusion perspective have been conducted in the context of the developed world where both income poverty and lack of transport are relative rather absolute states. In a unique departure from these previous studies, this paper explores the relationship between transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the key difference being that income poverty is absolute and where there is much lower access to both private and public transportation generally. Thus, it seeks to explore whether the concept of social exclusion remains valid, when it is the majority of the population that is experiencing transport and income poverty compared with the minority who do so in advanced economies. The paper is based on a scoping study for the Republic of South Africa Department of Transport (RSA DOT), which primarily involved focus group discussions with a range of socially deprived urban and peri-urban population groups living in the Tshwane region of South Africa. In a second departure from previous studies which consider transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the study takes a primarily urban focus. The rationale for this is that theoretically low income urban settlements do not suffer from the lack of transport infrastructure and motorised transport services in the way that more remote rural areas do. The policy issue is therefore less a question of addressing a deficit in supply and more one of addressing particular aspects of public transit service failure, which are more readily amenable to relatively low cost, manageable, small-scale national and local policy interventions. A primary aim for the study was to reinvigorate cross-government debate of these issues in the hope of breaking South African government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-standing and persistent policy inertia in the delivery of equitable and socially sustainable urban transport systems.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Transportation policy; Poverty; Disadvantage; Social exclusion; South Africa\\r\\n', b'\\n', b'Mengyi Li, Shahir Masri, Chun-Huo Chiu, Yi Sun, Jun Wu,\\r\\n', b'Mapping wild vascular plant species diversity in urban areas in California using crowdsourcing data by regression kriging: Examining socioeconomic disparities,\\r\\n', b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n', b'Volume 905,\\r\\n', b'2023,\\r\\n', b'166995,\\r\\n', b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n', b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166995.\\r\\n', b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723056206)\\r\\n', b'Abstract: Biodiversity is crucial for human health, but previous methods of measuring biodiversity require intensive resources and have other limitations.

GAM OK was further applied to extrapolate species diversity metrics from saturated grid cells (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0841) to the remaining grid cells with <80\\xc2\\xa0% sample completeness (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa03914) and generate diversity maps that cover the grid. Further, generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between species diversity and sociodemographic indicators at census tract level. The wild vascular plant species diversity metrics were inversely associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status (i.e., unemployment, linguistic isolation, educational attainment, and poverty rate). Minority populations (i.e., African American, Asian American, and Hispanic) and children had significantly lower diversity exposure in their neighborhoods. Crowdsourcing data offers a cost-effective solution for characterizing large-scale biodiversity in urban areas.\\r\\n', b'Keywords: Urban plant biodiversity; Vascular plant species diversity map; Socio-economic status; Citizen science\\r\\n']\n"

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Charlotte de Fraiture, Dennis Wichelns,\\r\\n',b'Satisfying future water demands for agriculture,\\r\\n',b'Agricultural Water Management,\\r\\n',b'Volume 97, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 502-511,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0378-3774,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.08.008.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037837740900239X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The global demand for water in agriculture will increase over time with increasing population, rising incomes, and changes in dietary preferences. Increasing demands for water by industrial and urban users, and water for the environment will intensify competition. At the same time, water scarcity is increasing in several important agricultural areas. We explore several pathways for ensuring that sufficient food is produced in the future, while also protecting the environment and reducing poverty. We examine four sets of scenarios that vary in their focus on investments in rainfed agriculture and irrigation, and the role of international trade in adjusting for national disparities in water endowments. Rainfed agriculture holds considerable potential but requires adequate mechanisms to reduce inherent risks. Irrigation expansion is warranted in places where water infrastructure is underinvested such as sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia the scope for improving irrigation performance and water productivity is high. International trade can help alleviate water problems in water-scarce areas, subject to economic and political considerations. We examine also a regionally optimized scenario that combines investments in rainfed and irrigated agriculture with strategic trade decisions. Compared to \\xe2\\x80\\x98business as usual\\xe2\\x80\\x99, this scenario reduces the amount of additional water required to meet food demands by 2050 by 80%. Some of that water could be made available for the environment and other sectors. We conclude that there are sufficient land and water resources available to satisfy global food demands during the next 50 years, but only if water is managed more effectively in agriculture.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Irrigation; Food security; Rainfed agriculture; Global outlook; Scenario analysis\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Abdul-Lateef Balogun, Olawale Emmanuel Olayide, Ulisses M.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Developing cities; Policies; Poverty; Vulnerability\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Marie T.

The unfolding global financial crisis, which brings higher unemployment and underemployment, is likely to further intensify this vulnerability. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban compared with the rural poor to these types of shocks. It reviews some of the unique characteristics of urban life that could make the urban poor particularly susceptible to price and financial shocks and summarizes the evidence regarding the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban poor. The focus is on impacts on poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. The review shows that although the urban poor are clearly one of the population groups most affected by the current (and previous) crises, the rural poor, landless, and net buyers are in no better position to confront the crisis without significant suffering. The poorest of the poor are the ones who will be most affected, irrespective of the continent, country, or urban or rural area where they live. The magnitude and severity of their suffering depends on their ability to adapt and on the specific nature, extent, and duration of the coping strategies they adopt. A better understanding of how these coping strategies are used and staggered is critical to help design triggers for action that can prevent households from moving to more desperate measures. Using these early coping strategies as early warning indicators could help prevent dramatic losses in welfare.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n',b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kwok Yan Chi Jackie,\\r\\n',b'Projecting Sustainable Living Environment for an Ageing Society: The Case of Hong Kong,\\r\\n',b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 17,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 675-684,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.084.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029613000868)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: In 2030, 22% of Hong Kong's total population will be aged 60 or older. In order to advocate Active Ageing1 in a qualified and sustainable environment, our research team has continuously investigated the habitable urban living environment for elderly people in Hong Kong. In 2009, we have completed a research on the practice of everyday life of an active group of elderly people. This research aimed to firstly understand how people aged 60 or above live actively in an urban environment; and secondly, to see if they are leading a quality life in Hong Kong. With this conceptual framework in mind, we wished to relate the environmental context to the ageing society. We organized the findings of this research into a conceptual framework to assess the use of urban space in Hong Kong. We wished to find out whether the use of it was fit for providing a qualified life for the older people. We find that while Hong Kong is a liveable city offering a vibrant city life, it is at the same time a \\xe2\\x80\\x98dual city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 where the high spending \\xe2\\x80\\x98nouveau riches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is gradually expelling the poorer citizens not only from the downtown area, but also from maintaining an affordable quality of living. Our findings strongly suggested that ageing is not a barrier to an active social life. In reality, poverty is the major factor that creates both helpless and hopeless feelings among the elderly people. In order to construct a sustainable environment which is \\xe2\\x80\\x98growing old\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the Hong Kong Government should integrate the concern of the older citizens into urban planning and design policies. The most important issue is to make the city life more affordable to all.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Sustainable Living Environment; Ageing society; Active Ageing; Quality of Life; Hong Kong\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gilberto Mahumane, Peter Mulder,\\r\\n',b'Urbanization of energy poverty?

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Luis Huicho, Eddy R Segura, Carlos A Huayanay-Espinoza, Jessica Ni\\xc3\\xb1o de Guzman, Maria Clara Restrepo-M\\xc3\\xa9ndez, Yvonne Tam, Aluisio J D Barros, Cesar G Victora,\\r\\n',b'Child health and nutrition in Peru within an antipoverty political agenda: a Countdown to 2015 country case study,\\r\\n',b'The Lancet Global Health,\\r\\n',b'Volume 4, Issue 6,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages e414-e426,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2214-109X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(16)00085-1.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X16000851)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Background\\r\\n',b\"Peru is an upper-middle-income country with wide social and regional disparities.

We obtained data from interviews with key informants, a literature review of published and unpublished data, national censuses, and governmental reports. We obtained information on social determinants of health, including economic growth, poverty, unmet basic needs, urbanisation, women's education, water supply, fertility rates, and child nutrition from the annual national households surveys and the Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys. We obtained national mortality data from the Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, and calculated subnational rates from 11 surveys. Analyses were stratified by region, wealth quintiles, and urban or rural residence. We calculated coverage indicators for the years 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x9313, and we used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to estimate the effect of changes in intervention coverage and in nutritional status on mortality.\\r\\n\",b'Findings\\r\\n',b'From 2000 to 2013, under-5 mortality fell by 58% from 39\\xc2\\xb78 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 16\\xc2\\xb77. LiST, which was used to predict the decline in mortality arising from changes in fertility rates, water and sanitation, undernutrition, and coverage of indicators of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health predicted that the under-5 mortality rate would fall from 39\\xc2\\xb78 to 28\\xc2\\xb74 per 1000 livebirths, accounting for 49\\xc2\\xb72% of the reported reduction. Neonatal mortality fell by 51% from 16\\xc2\\xb72 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 8\\xc2\\xb70.

Socioeconomic, urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural, and regional inequalities in coverage, mortality, and stunting were substantially reduced.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Silvia M.

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Cellular automata; Urban expansion; Global south; Remote sensing; Land cover change; Predictive modelling\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n',b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 67,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Komali Yenneti, Sabyasachi Tripathi, Yehua Dennis Wei, Wen Chen, Gaurav Joshi,\\r\\n',b'The truly disadvantaged?

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Michael B.

In the former category are key social agreements, for example, that urban development will be primarily carried out by the private sector, constrained only by planning laws that are mostly in the domain of local and state governments. Examples in the latter category include efforts to solve specific urban problems such as inadequate and unaffordable housing for low-income populations, or to respond to infrastructure deficiencies in transportation. All three countries in North America \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the United States, Canada, and Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are federal in their governance structure, so policy is necessarily distributed across the levels of government. As a result, central government plays only a limited role in key aspects of urban growth, though in Mexico there is a stronger tradition of centralization of policy. Within this framework, urban policy is diverse, but falls into three broad groupings. First, land use and development underpin urbanization; policy in these areas has existed from the earliest days in all three countries, exemplified by regulation of urban form. In North America, such regulation has, to varying degrees, supported market driven development. Second, urban policy deals with management of key functions, exemplified by transportation, public health, utilities, and environmental quality. Such policy occurs at all levels of government. Third, urban policy addresses social issues that have varied over time from the acculturation of immigrants, to poverty, housing, and race relations.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Federalism; Housing; Infrastructure; Land use; Planning; Policy; Poverty; Race; Transportation; Urban\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n',b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 132,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'105001,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Paul Milbourne, Shane Doheny,\\r\\n',b'Older people and poverty in rural Britain: Material hardships, cultural denials and social inclusions,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Rural Studies,\\r\\n',b'Volume 28, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 389-397,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0743-0167,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2012.06.007.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016712000691)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This paper explores the relations between older people, poverty and place in rural Britain. It develops previous work on rural poverty that has pointed both to the significance of older people within the rural poor population and to their denials of poverty. The paper also connects with recent discussions on the complexity of relations between poverty and social exclusion in later life, as well as key themes emerging from studies of older people in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods. Drawing on findings from a survey of 4000 households in rural Wales and interviews with older people in poverty in three rural places, the paper provides a detailed examination of the materialities and experiences of poverty among older people in rural places. In particular, it highlights how older poor groups construct their lives in complex terms with references made to both social inclusions and exclusions. The research also points to the significance of the socio-cultural contexts of place in shaping older people's understandings of poverty in rural areas.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Older people; Poverty; Social exclusion; Place; Rural\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Joanna L.

Meeting these challenges offers a means of furthering understanding and providing new insights into the geography of urban poverty and deprivation. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to mapping and analysing spatio-temporal patterns of household deprivation, assessing the distribution at the landscape level. The approach we develop has advantages over existing techniques because it is applicable in situations where i) conventional approaches based on choropleth mapping are not feasible due to boundary change and/or ii) where spatial relationships at a landscape level are of interest. Through the application of surface mapping techniques to disaggregate census count data, and by applying spatial metrics commonly used in ecology, we were able to compare the development of the spatial arrangement of deprivation between 1971 and 2011 in three UK cities of particular interest: Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool. Applying three spatial metrics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 spatial extent, patch density, and mean patch size \\xe2\\x80\\x93 revealed that over the 40\\xe2\\x80\\xafyear period household deprivation has been more spatially dispersed in Glasgow. This novel approach has enabled an analysis of deprivation distributions over time which is less affected by boundary change and which accurately assesses and quantifies the spatial relationships between those living with differing levels of deprivation. It thereby offers a new approach for researchers working in this area.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Spatial metrics; Surface mapping; Patterning of deprivation\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Florence Dery, Elijah Bisung, Bernard Abudho, Ophelia Soliku, George Dery,\\r\\n',b'Examining the health and wellbeing of women sanitation workers in Ghana and Kenya,\\r\\n',b'Wellbeing, Space and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 5,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'100167,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2666-5581,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2023.100167.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666558123000404)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: About 3.6 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed sanitation service. To bridge service gaps, informal sanitation businesses have emerged as alternative service providers to meet the sanitation needs of unserved populations. Informal sanitation workers include persons who empty septic tanks, clean toilets, sewers, and manage public toilets. They provide a fundamental public service particularly in areas where access to municipal sanitation service is limited. Through qualitative methodologies, this paper explores the lived experiences and associated health risks of women working in the informal sanitation sector in urban Ghana and Kenya. Our findings show that female informal sanitation workers were exposed to injuries and infections, stigma and discrimination, emotional and psychological distress, sexual harassment, and unhealthy coping strategies. Distinctively, younger female participants were more likely to experience sexual harassment. Because of social stigma, many of the women developed unsafe work practices such as refusal to wear PPE and working at night. By paying close attention to the embodied effects of informal sanitation work, we can better comprehend the daily politics, lived experiences, and urban social infrastructure regimes that have a significant impact on the quality of life of informal sanitation workers. The results are also crucial for developing programs for women's empowerment and labour and social protection policies, especially in lowincome settings where gender norms interact with income disparities and other sociopolitical issues to affect women's participation in the labor market.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Informal work; Qualitative approach; Sanitation; Health\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n',b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n',b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n',b'Volume 33,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'100626,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n',b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 172,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'106388,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n',b'Amare Molla Dinku, Tefera Chane Mekonnen, Getachew Shumye Adilu,\\r\\n',b'Urban food systems: Factors associated with food insecurity in the urban settings evidence from Dessie and Combolcha cities, north-central Ethiopia,\\r\\n',b'Heliyon,\\r\\n',b'Volume 9, Issue 3,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'e14482,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2405-8440,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14482.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023016894)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: In Ethiopia, food security and vulnerability assessments have traditionally focused on rural areas. Recently, the issue of urban food security has been attracting attention in global policy debates. However, limited studies are found in the study areas that link food insecurity with major food market chains in the urban food system settings. This study is therefore, aimed at measuring the status of food insecurity in the urban food systems. A mixed study design has been used with randomly selected 506 resident households in Dessie and Combolcha cities, of north-central Ethiopia. We used a pre-tested, semi-structured survey questionnaire to collect quantitative data. The qualitative data has been collected with key informant interview, and focus group discussion among food system actors and facilitators in the selected commodities. We applied Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) to measure the food security status and narration and summarization techniques to analyze the qualitative data. The study confirmed that 33.1% of the respondents were food insecure. Moreover, nine and six individuals per 100 people were forced to \\xe2\\x80\\x98sleep hungry\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98not eat in the whole day and night\\xe2\\x80\\x99 respectively. Households' food insecurity was significantly associated with the gender of the household head, participation in casual labor, and living house ownership. The degree of food insecurity was deemed to be higher due to weak food system governance, an inconsistent food supply chain, and socio-economic and gender inequalities. However, both formal and informal food systems have their own unique qualities and maximum food security benefit can be achieved if they are well integrated. This implies food security intervention in urban areas needs to refocus their strategies towards systematic and integrated approaches that can promote social security programs like: urban housing, job security, urban agriculture and inclusive food safety net programs. Moreover, multidimensional studies are still important to obtain a wider picture of sustainable urban food security in urban areas and to better integrate the formal and informal food systems.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban food system; Associations; Food insecurity; Mixed research design; North-central Ethiopia\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Besma Belhadj,\\r\\n',b'New fuzzy multiple regressions for the instantaneous and panel data \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe determinants of Poverty in the Countries MENA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d,\\r\\n',b'Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,\\r\\n',b'Volume 615,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'128565,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0378-4371,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2023.128565.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437123001206)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Habitually, to determine the effect of certain economic and social variables on poverty in MENA, a classical multiple regression with a framework defined a priori verifying several limiting assumptions and easily misused is used.

To achieve these ambitions, researchers should engage with communities, practitioners, and policy makers in a virtuous circle of research, policy, implementation, and active citizenship using the principles of co-design, co-implementation, co-evaluation, and co-translation. This Viewpoint provides an integrated perspective on the challenges that hinder the delivery of health-enhancing UGBS and recommendations to address them. Our recommendations include: strengthening the evidence beyond cross-sectional research designs, strengthening the evidence base on UGBS intervention approaches, evaluating the effects on diverse population groups and communities, addressing inequities in the distribution and quality of UGBS, accelerating research on blue space, providing evidence for environmental effects, incorporating co-design approaches, developing innovative modelling methods, fostering whole-system evidence, harnessing political drivers, creating collaborations for sustainable UGBS action, and advancing evidence in low-income and middle-income countries. The full potential of UGBS as public health, social, economic, and environmental assets is yet to be realised. Acting on the research and translation recommendations will aid in addressing these challenges in collaboration with research, policy, practice, and communities.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jian Nan XING, Wei GUO, Sha Sha QIAN, Zheng Wei DING, Fang Fang CHEN, Zhi Hang PENG, Qian Qian QIN, Lu WANG,\\r\\n',b'Association between Macroscopic-factors and Identified HIV/AIDS Cases among Injecting Drug Users: An Analysis Using Geographically Weighted Regression Model,\\r\\n',b'Biomedical and Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 27, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 311-318,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0895-3988,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.3967/bes2014.055.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895398814600490)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Alicia C.

Using a novel dataset derived from the full Ghanaian Census, we investigate how neighbourhood versus household socio-economic status (SES) relates to a set of household development outcomes (related to housing quality, energy, water and sanitation, and information technology) in Accra, Ghana. We then assess \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstranger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d households' outcomes within neighbourhoods: do poor households fare better in affluent neighbourhoods, and are affluent households negatively impacted by being in poor neighbourhoods? Through a simple generalized linear model we estimate the variance components associated with household and neighbourhood status for our outcome measures. Household SES is more closely associated with 13 of the 16 outcomes assessed compared to the neighbourhood average SES. For 9 outcomes poor households in affluent areas fair better, and the affluent in poor areas are worse off. For two outcomes, poor households have worse outcomes in affluent areas, and the affluent have better outcomes in poor areas, on average.

Government and stakeholders in the clean energy sector have been making efforts to increase the availability and accessibility to clean energy technologies for cooking. This study aims to analyse the determinants and constraints associated with the adoption of improved cooking stoves (ICS) in Ghana using a sample of 194 respondents purposively selected. By applying the logistic regression and non-parametric models, the study revealed that household size, education of the household head, availability of stoves and the intensity/ frequency of use impact adoption decisions. Furthermore, affordability, low level of awareness, accessibility, and poor quality of stoves are the ranked constraints hindering the widespread adoption of ICS. These findings have implications for consumers, stove manufacturers, financiers, promoters and the government. Strategies aimed at improving stove quality and promotional activities including training and public awareness through the media and public fora need to be vigorously pursued by stakeholders to ensure energy for all.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Determinants; Improved cook stoves; Fuel; Urban households; Ghana\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Laura A.

These interventions are considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplex\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in that they have many mechanisms of change and related outcomes. Few HVIPs clearly identify the underlying mechanisms of intervention and explicitly link those with key outcomes however, limiting the field\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to know what works best and for whom.

To aid researchers, evaluators, students, and program developers, we describe the use of Grounded Theory as a methodology to enhance the development of complex interventions, illuminating a non-linear approach that engages key stakeholders. To illustrate application, we describe a case example of The Antifragility Initiative, a HVIP in Cleveland, Ohio. The development of the program theory of change was conducted in four phases: (1) review of existing program documents, (2) semi-structured interviews with program developers (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa06), (3) a focus group with program stakeholders (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa08), and (4) interviews with caregivers and youth (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa08). Each phase informed the next and culminated in a theoretical narrative and visual model of the Antifragility Initiative.

The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difficult task as their allocation is typically endogenous. To overcome this identification problem, we exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of land titles. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former owners' land to entitle the occupants. Some original owners accepted the government compensation, while others disputed the compensation payment in the slow Argentine courts. These different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of property rights across squatters. Using data from two surveys performed in 2003 and 2007, we find that entitled families substantially increased housing investment, reduced household size, and enhanced the education of their children relative to the control group. These effects, however, did not take place through improvements in access to credit. Our results suggest that land titling can be an important tool for poverty reduction, albeit not through the shortcut of credit access, but through the slow channel of increased physical and human capital investment, which should help to reduce poverty in future generations.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Property rights; Land titling; Natural experiment; Urban poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Md.

While there are some skepticism toward urban agricultural activities in providing food for the urban markets, this study has nevertheless explored the existing evidence of its effectiveness in providing food security among urban dwellers and consequently reducing a large share of their food bills. Interviews of 360 households shown a positive statistical association between obtaining a sufficient quantity of food and adequate diet through engagement in urban agriculture. The results from this study indicate that food security can be derived from urban agriculture since it provides sufficient quantities of food, appropriate nutrition, cost-effective food supplies and reduction in food bills.

Yet these policies have not protected Portland from broader trends that have increased urban poverty over the past several decades in the U.S., including social welfare cuts and the shift in the economy to the service sector. In terms of poverty dynamics and social policies, we argue that while regional planning and other progressive policies have helped protect Portland from extremely high concentrated poverty present in many large U.S. cities, it has still experienced growing social dislocations associated with national and macro-level social and economic factors. These trends suggest both the possibilities and limits of local policy, regional planning, and activism for ameliorating the deleterious consequences of social welfare retrenchment and franchise capitalism for vulnerable urban populations, and highlight the importance of the broader social policy context and economic change for understanding urban poverty and the experiences of the urban poor.\\r\\n\",b'\\n',b'Penlope Yaguma, Hakimu Sseviiri, Priti Parikh, Yacob Mulugetta,\\r\\n',b'Asset ownership and electricity access in the urban informal settlements of Kampala, Uganda,\\r\\n',b'Energy for Sustainable Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 76,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'101294,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0973-0826,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2023.101294.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0973082623001515)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Delivering on the promise of SDG7 for low-income communities will require that we appropriately measure energy access. However, common measures use narrow indicators which do not acknowledge that poor households draw on multiple assets to access electricity. Using the asset pentagon of DFID's sustainable livelihoods framework, this study investigated asset ownership in a slum in Kampala, Uganda in relation to electricity access. Data were collected using household surveys [n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0450], and a multidimensional index and regression models applied to deduce asset ownership with respect to electricity access. We find that asset ownership is weak, especially for financial and natural assets compared to human, social and physical assets where households are better off. Grid-connected households exhibit stronger asset ownership than the unconnected, and assets also differ between residences, businesses, and mixed-use households. Households also interact with, manage, and leverage multiple assets to access electricity, depending on the ease with which those assets can be converted or exchanged for electricity. Policy and service provision should espouse existing everyday means of accessing electricity by capitalising on the assets in which households are strongest. Further, electricity provision goals for slums should be strongly linked with asset ownership and tangible livelihood outcomes for households, and exploring the micro-politics of electricity access and provision could offer directions for actualizing this linkage. Sustainable livelihoods approaches offer a valuable entry point for understanding energy access in deprived urban settings, from a perspective that encompasses multiple priorities for sustainable and inclusive urbanisation.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Livelihood assets; Electricity access; Slums; Informal settlements; Kampala; Uganda\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Yacouba Kassouri, Oluyemi Adewole Okunlola,\\r\\n',b'Analysis of spatio-temporal drivers and convergence characteristics of urban development in Africa,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 112,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'105868,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.105868.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837721005913)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Understanding the trajectory of urbanization and its drivers is particularly important in the new urban agenda set out under sustainable development goal 11 on cities and human settlements.

This recognition has led many cities, around the world, to engage more actively in food policies and programs. The literature documenting this experience is largely case study-based and primarily covers actions and outcomes in larger cities. We analyze the overall state of urban food policy across Asia, drawing attention to distinctive patterns across city size categories and testing hypotheses which may explain the diversity of observed patterns of food policy engagement. Particular attention is given to demographic, institutional, and geographical factors which have likely influenced either the motivation or the capacities of cities to act on food matters. We find that most Asian cities are at an early stage in efforts to apply coherent and coordinated approaches to address food-related challenges and opportunities. The opportunities for future economic gain and avoidance of social costs may be greatest among the region's fast-growing small- and medium-sized cities, yet many such cities lack the requisite capacities to influence complex food system matters and will require assistance from national agencies and others.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Cities; Asia; Urban food policy; Food systems; Food smart; Benchmarking\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ashley Schram, Ronald Labont\\xc3\\xa9, David Sanders,\\r\\n',b'Urbanization and International Trade and Investment Policies as Determinants of Noncommunicable Diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases,\\r\\n',b'Volume 56, Issue 3,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 281-301,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0033-0620,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcad.2013.09.016.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033062013001692)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: There are three dominant globalization pathways affecting noncommunicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): urbanization, trade liberalization, and investment liberalization. Urbanization carries potential health benefits due to improved access to an increased variety of food imports, although for the growing number of urban poor, this has often meant increased reliance on cheap, highly processed food commodities.

This is particularly so in Africa, which has high rates of urban population growth and high levels of urban food insecurity. There has, however, been surprisingly little work on examining the existing processes through which urban food systems are governed. In this article, based on a review of the relevant literature, I examine what we know about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa. The governance of urban food systems in Africa is complex, with a range of governance actors with competing agendas. These governance actors impact on urban food systems, and thus on urban food security, in a variety of ways, including: the impact on food production (e.g. urban and peri-urban agriculture); the impact on the distribution of food; the impact on the retail of food by formal and informal traders; and the impact on food safety. There are many gaps in our knowledge about urban governance and urban food systems in Africa, including: processes in secondary cities; the role of, and impact of, local governments on urban food systems; the impact of inadequate transport systems on food distribution; and the impact of supermarkets (and their expanding supply chains) on urban food systems. We need to better understand existing urban governance processes, and their impacts on urban food systems, in order to be able to collaboratively design interventions to improve urban food security in Africa.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Africa; Urban governance; Food systems; Food security\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'F.

Poor residential building thermal quality in the least advantaged neighbourhoods is a significant vector in inhabitant vulnerability. As this cross-cutting, complex problem must be broached comprehensively and on an urban scale, a methodology is proposed that would include a multidimensional fuel poverty index for application to deprived neighbourhoods. The method is illustrated with a case study for the city of Madrid, Spain. Data published by the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Urban Deprivation Observatory were cross-referenced with those from earlier studies to quantify fuel poverty and determine its spatial distribution. In future the findings will be related to basic indicators to formulate the nationwide list of deprived neighbourhoods and to the results of other fuel poverty-specific methodologies, from building energy inefficiency to those addressing causes and consequences. In addition to including the specifics of fuel poverty in urban deprivation analysis, the findings suggest that data from the observatories participating in the Urban Poverty Partnership might be cross-referenced with those of the EU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Energy Poverty Observatory (EPOV).\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Varsha S.

In other words, the higher the inequality in the income distribution, the lower is the growth elasticity of poverty. However, with the publication of Piketty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magnum opus (2014), and a subsequent study by Chancel and Piketty (2017) of evolution of income inequality in India since 1922, the focus has shifted to the income disparity between the richest 1% (or 0.01%) and the bottom 50%. Their central argument is that the rapid growth of income at the top end of millionaires and billionaires is a by-product of growth. The present study extends this argument by linking it to poverty indices in India. Based on the India Human Development Survey 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9312 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a nationwide panel survey-we examine the links between poverty and income inequality, especially in the upper tail relative to the bottom 50%, state affluence (measured in per capita income) and their interaction or their joint effect. Another feature of our research is that we analyse their effects on the FGT class of poverty indices. The results are similar in as much as direction of association is concerned but the elasticities vary with the poverty index. The growth elasticities are negative and significant for all poverty indices. In all three cases, the disparity between the income share of the top 1% and share of the bottom 50% is associated with greater poverty. These elasticities are much higher than the (absolute) income elasticities except in the case of the poverty gap. The largest increase occurs in the poverty gap squared \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a 1% greater income disparity is associated with a 1.24% higher value of this index. Thus the consequences of even a small increase in the income disparity are alarming for the poorest.\\r\\n',b\"Keywords: Income inequality; Piketty's measure; FGT class of poverty indices; Inequality and poverty; India\\r\\n\",b'\\n',b'Nabila Asghar, Muhammad Asif Amjad, Hafeez ur Rehman, Mubbasher Munir, Reda Alhajj,\\r\\n',b'Achieving sustainable development resilience: Poverty reduction through affordable access to electricity in developing economies,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Cleaner Production,\\r\\n',b'Volume 376,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'134040,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0959-6526,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134040.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622036125)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Energy is indispensable to bringing off the growing human demand, and it is a challenging global issue to achieve sustainable development goals by using clean energy. The present study evaluates whether access to electricity helps decline poverty in developing countries. For this purpose, the impact of access to electricity on the total population, rural and urban populations on poverty have been analyzed from 1990 to 2020 in 82 developing countries. Empirical results are obtained through the non-linear Panel ARDL approach. The results show that rural and urban population's access to electricity to the total population proposes the inverted U-shaped relationship with poverty. As a result, increased access to electricity initially contributes to poverty but eventually causes it to reduce. Based on these findings, the study suggests that in order to combat poverty, the countries with poor access to electricity should grant everyone easy and affordable access to power.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Poverty; Electricity; Non-linear ARDL; Sustainable development goal; Developing countries\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jean Christophe Fotso, Nyovani Madise, Angela Baschieri, John Cleland, Eliya Zulu, Martin Kavao Mutua, Hildah Essendi,\\r\\n',b'Child growth in urban deprived settings: Does household poverty status matter?

There is a strong association between food poverty and stunting among children aged 6\\xe2\\x80\\x9311 months (p<0.01), while assets poverty and subjective poverty have stronger relationships (p<0.01) with undernutrition at older age (24 months or older for assets poverty, and 12 months or older for subjective poverty).

The data is drawn from a survey of 6453 households from 11 Southern African cities. The findings indicate that infrastructure access significantly predicted HFIAP and MAHFP scores. The regression analyses demonstrated that households with inconsistent or no access to a cash income, cooking fuel, medical care, electricity, or water had 11 times greater odds of being categorized as food insecure in the HFIAP and 8.5 times greater odds of having less than 12months of adequate food provisioning in the last year. Household income alone does not sufficiently account for these relationships. The correlation analyses demonstrate a strong association between all the LPI subscales and household food access. These results clarify the differential impact of social and physical infrastructure on household food security and demonstrate that the prevailing conditions of an urban environment may better explain (and predict) urban household food security than household income alone. This investigation emphasizes the central role that urban planning and development can play in reducing food insecurity in poor urban neighborhoods.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban; Food security; Poverty; HFIAS; MAHFP; LPI\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Bernard Gauthier, Waly Wane,\\r\\n',b'Bypassing health providers: The quest for better price and quality of health care in Chad,\\r\\n',b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n',b'Volume 73, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 540-549,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.06.008.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953611003534)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper investigates individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bypassing behavior in the health sector in Chad and the determinants of individuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 facility choice.

We obtained information on social determinants of health, including economic growth, poverty, unmet basic needs, urbanisation, women's education, water supply, fertility rates, and child nutrition from the annual national households surveys and the Peruvian Demographic and Health Surveys. We obtained national mortality data from the Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, and calculated subnational rates from 11 surveys.

LiST, which was used to predict the decline in mortality arising from changes in fertility rates, water and sanitation, undernutrition, and coverage of indicators of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health predicted that the under-5 mortality rate would fall from 39\\xc2\\xb78 to 28\\xc2\\xb74 per 1000 livebirths, accounting for 49\\xc2\\xb72% of the reported reduction. Neonatal mortality fell by 51% from 16\\xc2\\xb72 deaths per 1000 livebirths to 8\\xc2\\xb70. Stunting prevalence remained stable at around 30% until 2007, decreasing to 17\\xc2\\xb75% by 2013, and the composite coverage index for essential health interventions increased from 75\\xc2\\xb71% to 82\\xc2\\xb76%, with faster increases among the poor, in rural areas, and in the Andean region. Socioeconomic, urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural, and regional inequalities in coverage, mortality, and stunting were substantially reduced. The proportion of the population living below the poverty line reduced from 47\\xc2\\xb78% to 23\\xc2\\xb79%, women with fewer than 4 years of schooling reduced from 11\\xc2\\xb75% to 6\\xc2\\xb79%, urbanisation increased from 68\\xc2\\xb71% to 75\\xc2\\xb76%, and the total fertility rate decreased from 3\\xc2\\xb70 children per woman to 2\\xc2\\xb74.

Longer durations of time spent on housing assistance have led to debates around public housing as more of a cause than an effect of poverty spells. This article analyzes the determinants of exit among public housing residents. Using a sample from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics, this article ascertains the individual characteristics and neighborhood factors associated with longer spell durations. The results suggest that most public housing residents exit public housing in the first 5\\xc2\\xa0years. In terms of individual characteristics, spell length, age and income played a modest role in understanding public housing exits. In addition, neighborhoods with higher levels of poverty and median household income had significant positive effects on the odds of exiting public housing. However, the effect sizes of household characteristics and neighborhood conditions were relatively small when considering the post-1996 era of policy reform. The results suggest that public housing exits may largely be due to shifts in housing policy and social welfare programs rather than household characteristics and neighborhood conditions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Public housing; Poverty; Welfare; Spells; Neighborhoods\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Syed Ainuddin, Jayant Kumar Routray, Shabana Ainuddin,\\r\\n',b\"People's risk perception in earthquake prone Quetta city of Baluchistan,\\r\\n\",b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n',b'Volume 7,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 165-175,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2013.10.006.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420913000575)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Large parts of Pakistan lie within a seismically active Himalayan belt.

The study explored the relationship among different variables including socio-economic status of the respondents using multivariate statistics. The results revealed that earthquake risk perception associates significantly with the people's age, income, education etc. Further, the perception of earthquake risk varies among different governmental and non-governmental organizations and community members. The survey results also reveal that people know the risks posed by earthquakes but have fatalistic attitudes towards the future predictions of the earthquakes.

This paper shows that the reform was primarily driven by the need to secure electricity supply and cut down tariffs. These national objectives ousted other issues, and notably those that find their expression at the urban level, among which the question of access to electricity in Metro Manila's urban poor communities. The central state withdrew its attention from the issue of electrification, and local actors had to react as they were confronted to social tensions and practices of pilferage. As a consequence, city governments and local administrations are getting involved in this issue, which opens the way to participation of civil society. This paper shows how the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crolling back\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the central state led to new partnerships and arrangements between the distribution utility, local governments and community organisations.

This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Yonas Alem, Gunnar K\\xc3\\xb6hlin, Jesper Stage,\\r\\n',b'The Persistence of Subjective Poverty in Urban Ethiopia,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 56,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 51-61,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.10.017.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13002295)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Using data spanning 15years, we study subjective and consumption poverty in urban Ethiopia.

Several individual, family, peer, community, and societal risk and protective factors determine or modify the risk of firearm violence. Specifically, there is a strong relationship between poverty, income inequality, and firearm violence; as such, interventions that influence upstream determinants of health by providing income support may hold much promise in affecting multiple domains of risk that are on the causal pathway to firearm violence. Guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews, we conducted a scoping review to examine the current state of evidence on the relationship between income support policies and risk of firearm violence. We searched 8 databases related to health and social sciences from inception through March 30, 2022, and placed no time, language, setting, or other publication restrictions on our search, as long as the study was quantitative or mixed-methods and addressed firearm violence specifically, rather than violence more broadly, as an outcome in relation to income support policies. We found 4 studies; of those, 3 were conducted in the United States and 1 in Brazil. All 4 found associations of policy-relevant magnitude between income support policies and reductions in risk of inter-personal firearm violence. We propose future opportunities to enhance the substantive scope and methodologic rigor of this field of research and inform policy and practice for greater impact.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Income; Poverty; Firearms; Guns; Violence; Social; Public; Policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Olalekan John Taiwo,\\r\\n',b'Determinants of peri-urban and urban agricultural locational choice behaviour in Lagos, Nigeria,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 39,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 320-330,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.02.003.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837714000234)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This article quantitatively assessed factors that shape locational choice behaviour of urban farmers. Three hundred questionnaires were randomly administered to farmers in ten localities with a view to identifying factors that shape their locational choice behaviour. The average number of farmers per locality was designated as the index of attractiveness and was correlated with six broad categories of factors identified by farmers as influential in urban agricultural site selection. These broad factors are proximity to water, proximity to residence, access to land, proximity to market, suitable fertile soils, and availability of labour. These factors were subsequently broken down to sixteen categories. Almost all the variables exhibited negatively significant correlations with the index of attractiveness. Urban farmers prefer sites which were closer to water, free with minimal lease and rental cost, and also sites with fertile soil that is closer to farmer's residence, where aggregate costs of production is minimal and labour relatively available. The results obtained can be used in mainstreaming urban agriculture into city planning while at the same time provide avenue for increased urban agricultural productivity.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Transportation cost; Urban agriculture; Distance; Urbanization\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Karen Clay, Joshua Lewis, Edson Severnini,\\r\\n',b'What explains cross-city variation in mortality during the 1918 influenza pandemic?

This paper uses newly assembled historical data on annual mortality across 438 U.S. cities to explore the determinants of pandemic mortality. We assess the role of three broad factors: i) pre-pandemic population health and poverty, ii) air pollution, and iii) the timing of onset and proximity to military bases. Using regression analysis, we find that cities in the top tercile of the distribution of pre-pandemic infant mortality had 21 excess deaths per 10,000 residents in 1918 relative to cities in the bottom tercile. Similarly, cities in the top tercile of the distribution of proportion of illiterate residents had 21.3 excess deaths per 10,000 residents during the pandemic relative to cities in the bottom tercile. Cities in the top tercile of the distribution of coal-fired electricity generating capacity, an important source of urban air pollution, had 9.1 excess deaths per 10,000 residents in 1918 relative to cities in the bottom tercile. There was no statistically significant relationship between excess mortality and city proximity to World War I bases or the timing of onset. In a counterfactual analysis, the three statistically significant factors accounted for 50 percent of cross-city variation in excess mortality in 1918.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Influenza; Pandemic; Mortality; Air pollution\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Komali Yenneti, Sabyasachi Tripathi, Yehua Dennis Wei, Wen Chen, Gaurav Joshi,\\r\\n',b'The truly disadvantaged?

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Carl Johan Lagerkvist, Sebastian Hess, Julius Okello, Helena Hansson, Nancy Karanja,\\r\\n',b'Food health risk perceptions among consumers, farmers, and traders of leafy vegetables in Nairobi,\\r\\n',b'Food Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 38,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 92-104,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0306-9192,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.11.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919212001157)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Urban and peri-urban farming and supply chains are becoming increasingly important for delivering perishable produce to the urban centers of the developing world to meet the demands of a growing population. However, some production and handling practises and a short supply chain may expose consumers to substantial health risks. This study of consumers, peri-urban farmers, and traders attempts to quantify subjective risk judgments with regard to food safety hazards, and examines the extent of discrepancies in perceived risk relating to vegetables in domestic urban markets among the three groups. A conceptual model was developed to elicit subjective risk perceptions for a multidimensional construct. In general, differences were found between respondent categories in terms of both specific source risks and overall risks. Differences were also found with respect to the socio-demographic and structural determinants of the levels of perceived risks. These findings can help improve policies to promote food safety and reduce risky food handling along the supply chain, and present opportunities for change.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food health risk; Peri-urban farming; Consumers; Farmers; Traders; Risk perception; Vegetables; Short supply chains\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Abubakari Ahmed, Stephen Boahen Asabere, Ellis Adjei Adams, Zaid Abubakari,\\r\\n',b'Patterns and determinants of multidimensional poverty in secondary cities: Implications for urban sustainability in African cities,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 134,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'102775,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102775.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397523000358)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Urban poverty research on African cities has focused mainly on megacities and large metropolitan areas. Despite their critical role in Africa's urbanization and development, secondary cities have received limited scholarly attention. Studies on secondary cities are unidimensional and rely mostly on secondary information from national census data. Using Wa, a secondary city in Ghana, this study assesses spatial patterns and determinants of multidimensional poverty, measured by two metrics: multidimensional poverty index (MPI) and multidimensional energy poverty index (MEPI). Spatially explicit primary data were collected from 775 households differentiated into core and fringe neighbourhoods. Mean MPI was significantly lower in core neighbourhoods than in fringe neighbourhoods. However, we found no statistically significant difference in MEPI between core and fringe neighbourhoods. The distribution of MPI is variably influenced by location and space but not MEPI. Although MPI was generally low, most areas with low MPI still had high MEPI, suggesting that energy access may be major problem even in secondary cities with low poverty. MPI was largely influenced negatively by household size and education. There was a significant negative relationship between MEPI and the food consumption score, suggesting a strong inverse relationship between food security and energy poverty. Together, the findings imply that scaling up the adoption of clean cooking energy in secondary cities can play a key role in addressing multidimensional urban poverty and advancing urban sustainability.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Multidimensional poverty; New urban agenda; Energy; Urban sustainability; Secondary cities; Africa\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Laura Sara Wainer, Lawrence J.

This paper draws on an investigation of living conditions in Ciudad del Bicentenario, a large-scale housing project on the outskirts of Cartagena. Based on a sample of seventy-five lengthy semistructured interviews with low-income residents and ten other stakeholders, we reached three paradoxical findings that reveal the high costs of free housing: the immediate improvement of overall quality of life but the impoverishment of economic prospects; the dual social condition of the residents who felt socially and economically isolated but also shared a widespread perception of being \\xe2\\x80\\x98revueltos\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or scrambled within the community of Ciudad del Bicentenario itself; and the growth of economic and physical informality in a project intended to counter the informal settlements in the inner city. These paradoxes reflect more than simple processes of impoverishment of living conditions: they demonstrate how this type of public policy systematically complexifies the daily life of relocated families. Sociologically, these findings reveal a new type of peri-urban poverty in the global South. We argue that the productive informalization of the formal housing projects constitutes a central, but previously understudied, aspect of what it means to develop equitable housing.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Low-income housing; Urban informality; Poverty alleviation; Homeownership; Latin America; Megaprojects\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'M.K.

Despite this reality, previous national inventories of fuel choices in these settlements were based on the most preferred fuel rather than the whole fuel composite used by the households. This paper, therefore, examines the fuel combinations that households in informal settlements of Kisumu City use and how their socio-economic characteristics influence their choice of these combinations. The paper is premised on the energy stacking theory. The study sampled 419 households from informal settlements of Kisumu City. Multinomial logistic regression is used to establish correlation between household characteristics and fuel combination choices. The findings show that majority of households in urban informal settlements of Kisumu City use multiple fuels for cooking, with charcoal and liquefied petroleum gas being the most commonly stacked fuels. Education does not have a strong correlation with fuel choices; whereas household size reliably predicts the choice of individual fuels. Household income significantly predicts the adoption of fuel stacks that have liquefied petroleum gas and charcoal. While increase in household income has a positive correlation with adoption of modern fuels, it does not lead to households dropping primitive and transitional fuels from their stacks. The study asserts that the energy stacking theory is a suitable basis for assessing the relationship between household-based socioeconomic determinants and fuel combination choices among residents of SSA cities. The reality of fuel stacking in urban informal settlements requires policies geared towards increasing access to modern household fuel technologies while incentivizing adoption of fuel-efficient biomass stoves.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy stacking; Household fuel; Informal settlements; Cooking fuels; Cookstoves\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ronghao Jiang, George C.S.

Studies of the growth and transformation of Chinese cities are characterized by continuing debates between those who insisted on the pivotal role played by the Chinese Party-state and others who envisioned urban China as moving decisively toward capitalism. This research examines the pattern and process of land marketization in urban China as a case to understand the interaction between the state and market forces in China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ongoing urban transformation. Statistical analysis of the data for the Chinese cities at and above the prefectural level for the years of 2003\\xe2\\x80\\x932017 has identified an uneven geography of land marketization effectively shaped by a localization of state-market interplay. A significant and positive correlation is found between the degree of land finance and extent of land marketization. The uneven geography of land marketization is significantly influenced by the legacy of the socialist planned economy as measured by the dominance of state-owned enterprises. However, the strength and direction of the correlation between the state and market are found to be contingent upon the level of urban economic growth. Spatial variation in land marketization is also shaped by the degree of openness, local state policies toward industrial vis-\\xc3\\xa0-vis commercial and residential land supply, population density, and the size of the city. Findings of this research call for a theoretical reconsideration of the state-market relationship in urban transformation more attentive to local conditions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Land market; Land use type; Urbanization; State-market relation; Neoliberalization; Chinese cities at and above the prefectural level\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Eefke Mollee, Mari\\xc3\\xa8ve Pouliot, Morag A.

While urbanisation causes landscape changes, little is known of how this process affects the use of wild plant resources by urban populations. This study contributes to addressing this knowledge gap by exploring the prevalence and determinants of urban collectors of wild plants in Kampala, Uganda. During February to August 2015, 93 structured interviews were conducted in inner, outer, and peri-urban areas of the city. The findings in this study show that urban wild plants are used by almost half (47%) of the respondents, mainly for medicinal purposes but also as a complement to diets. The findings further indicate that residents with lower income, of younger age (<51years old), and predominantly living in peri-urban areas are more likely to be urban collectors. Seasonality appears to be of greater importance in collection of food plants than of medicinal plants. Overall, these findings indicate that wild plants occupy an important role in the livelihoods and traditions of Kampala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents, and we argue that this should be taken into account in urban planning projects.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Livelihoods; Natural resource management; Non-timber forest products; Safety net; Urban ecosystems; Human ecology\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Peter Warr,\\r\\n',b'Chapter 25 - Poverty Reduction and the Composition of Growth in the Mekong Economies,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Arsenio M.

The region is defined here as the seven economies that border the Mekong River: five countries, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, and Vietnam; plus two provinces of China, Guangxi and Yunnan. Very little empirical work exists on the quantitative relationship between the rate of poverty reduction in these economies and the rate and nature of their economic growth. This chapter, which focuses on the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors of these seven economies, examines whether the sectoral composition of growth is relevant for the rate at which poverty incidence declines, given the overall rate of economic growth. The results confirm that poverty reduction is strongly related to growth of real gross domestic product per person but that the sectoral composition of this growth is also important.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: poverty incidence; economic growth; Mekong economies\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Yuko Tsujita,\\r\\n',b'Factors that prevent children from gaining access to schooling: A study of Delhi slum households,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Educational Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 33, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 348-357,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0738-0593,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2012.08.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059312001095)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper examines the factors that prevent slum children aged 5\\xe2\\x80\\x9314 from gaining access to schooling in light of the worsening urban poverty and sizable increase in rural-to-urban migration.

The mixture model decomposes the marginal distribution of durables ownership across all households, into three conditional distributions (one each for lower, middle and upper classes), along with their weights in the population distribution, endogenously determining class membership. This approach provides a potentially deeper understanding of the dynamics of classes, in particular the lower class, than can be obtained using poverty lines or PCA alone. It avoids many well-known problems with expenditure data, ameliorates the impact of changing survey designs, and enables an analysis of the behavior and membership of classes over time. I use the mixture approach to show that the urban lower class in India became smaller but poorer during the 1990s.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Durable ownership; Consumption class; Relative poverty; Poverty line; Mixture model; EM algorithm; Indian poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b\"Marisol Silva-Laya, Natalia D'Angelo, Elda Garc\\xc3\\xada, Laura Z\\xc3\\xba\\xc3\\xb1iga, Teresa Fern\\xc3\\xa1ndez,\\r\\n\",b'Urban poverty and education.

The analysis addresses: a) the educational achievement of the urban poor and b) the conditions under which they receive education. Results show that, despite attending school, the urban poor are not able to fully satisfy their right to education. Their educational achievement is deficient in terms of learning, educational trajectory and the capacity to aspire to a better future and although they are included in schooling, material deprivation combined with socio-territorial characteristics and cultural and administrative obstacles means that this inclusion occurs in a stratified manner. The findings urge a reexamination of the discussion around the challenge of education in facilitating social mobility.

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rudo V.

Even though riverbanks are considered the most endangered ecosystems globally, they continue to face degradation through cultivation, putting pressure on land use. This study assessed socioeconomic determinants of participating in riverbank cultivation at the household level. Open-ended questionnaire was administered as the main data collection tool. Questionnaire survey data were collected from 244 households living in thirteen unplanned compounds. This was complemented with transect walks. Data was then analyzed using the logistic regression model to establish socio-economic drivers that significantly drove river and stream bank cultivation. The findings from the study show that riverbank cultivation promoted livelihoods of the poor, household head's age positively influenced riverbank cultivation, unprecedented levels of poverty, unemployment and education level strongly contributed to household's decision to cultivate on riverbanks for them to be food secure and generate income. Larger family households had higher demand for food consumption putting more pressure on riverbank cultivation for food provisions. Unclear land titles stood out as major challenge households faced, whilst male household heads had entitlement to agricultural land. Declining soil fertility led to low agriculture productivity driving households to cultivate riverbanks where soils were more productive throughout the year. The current land-use and agricultural policies are indifferent towards riverbank cultivation in Zambia, with the effect of encouraging the practice. The study recommends strengthening the enforcement of laws governing riverbank cultivation.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Agriculture expansion; Land use, Semi-arid environments, Sustainable livelihoods, Wetlands\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Manob Das, Arijit Das, Ashis Mandal,\\r\\n',b'Exploring the factors affecting urban ecological risk: A case from an Indian mega metropolitan region,\\r\\n',b'Geoscience Frontiers,\\r\\n',b'Volume 14, Issue 1,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'101488,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1674-9871,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2022.101488.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674987122001414)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Assessment of ecological risk (ER) is a key approach to adapting and mitigating ecological deterioration in cities of developing countries. In developing countries, the ecological landscapes such as vegetation cover, water bodies, and wetlands are highly vulnerable due to rapid urban expansion. Therefore, urban ER (UER) assessment and its drivers are crucial to guide ecological protection as well as restoration. This study aims to explore the spatiotemporal pattern of UER and the impact of urban spatial form on UER in the Kolkata Megacity Region (KMR), India. This study developed a UER index and used spatial regression models across the urban centres. The ER has been assessed at city scale as well as grid-scale (2\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa02\\xc2\\xa0km and 5\\xc2\\xa0km\\xc2\\xa0\\xc3\\x97\\xc2\\xa05\\xc2\\xa0km) from 2000 to 2020. The results showed that ER has substantially increased over the last 20\\xc2\\xa0years. The urban centres with very high and high ER substantially increased, i.e. from 21.95% in 2000 to 31.70% in 2020. Kolkata and its surrounding urban centres were mostly characterized by very high and high ER. ER was influenced by spatial variables (such as land use and landscapes pattern). However, remote sensing parameters were weakly related to ER. The spatial lag model (SLM) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8686) was found to be better fit model than spatial error model (SEM) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8661) and ordinary linear regression model (OLS) (R2\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa00.8641). Thus, the findings of the study can improve research and a comprehensive framework for urban ecological resources and provide a scientific basis for urban ecosystem planning and restoration. In addition to this, it will guarantee the sustainable utilization of urban ecosystems.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban ecological risk; Kolkata metropolitan area; Ecosystem services; Ecological protection; Urban form\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Joanna Vearey, Ingrid Palmary, Liz Thomas, Lorena Nunez, Scott Drimie,\\r\\n',b'Urban health in Johannesburg: The importance of place in understanding intra-urban inequalities in a context of migration and HIV,\\r\\n',b'Health & Place,\\r\\n',b'Volume 16, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 694-702,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1353-8292,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.02.007.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829210000274)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Developing country urban contexts present multiple challenges to those responsible for ensuring the good health of urban populations.

These slums evoke a more or less stereotype impression of built environments: complex, high dense alignments of small makeshift or run-down shelters. However, this perceived characteristic morphology is neither globally homogeneous nor is this perception covering morphologic appearances of urban poverty in a comprehensive way. This research provides an empirical baseline study of existing morphologies, their similarities and differences across the globe. To do so, we conceptually approach urban poverty as places which provide relatively cheap living spaces serving as possible access to the city, to its society and to its functions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so called Arrival Cities. Based on a systematic literature survey we select a sample of 44 Arrival Cities across the globe. Using very high resolution optical satellite data in combination with street view images and field work we derive level of detail-1 3D-building models for all study areas. We measure the spatial structure of these settlements by the spatial pattern (by three features \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building density, building orientation and heterogeneity of the pattern) and the morphology of individual buildings (by two features \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building size and height). We develop a morphologic settlement type index based on all five features allowing categorization of Arrival Cities. We find a large morphologic variety for built environments of the urban poor, from slum and slum-like structures to formal and planned structures. This variability is found on all continents, within countries and even within a single city. At the same time detected categories (such as slums) are found to have very similar physical features across the globe.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Informal settlements; Urban poverty; Building morphologies; Urban pattern; Remote sensing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xin Tong, Jae Hong Kim,\\r\\n',b'Concentration or diffusion?

This study examines how poverty distribution has changed in the Los Angeles-Long Beach Combined Statistical Area and why. More specifically, an investigation is made to capture the detailed changes of poverty rates in over three thousand census tracts over the last two decades and to identify driving forces behind these spatiotemporal changes by employing spatial regression models. Results show that high poverty areas have stretched over space, not in a way that expands their overall size but in a way that increases the degree of spatial fragmentation throughout the last two decades. The results also reveal that neighborhood poverty change is largely shaped by wealth clustering and other spatially-explicit processes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Neighborhood change; Poverty distribution; Wealth clustering; Southern California\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jonathan Furszyfer Del Rio, Dylan D.

It also hampers the ability of planners to implement more equitable and just decarbonization pathways. Research has revealed that climate policies have imposed a financial burden on low-income and other vulnerable groups by increasing food and energy prices, leading as well to global inequality. Similarly, researchers have warned that in developing countries, emission mitigation policies could increase poverty rates and even frustrate progress towards universal access to clean energy. This research explores whether low-income social groups experience a 'double energy vulnerability', a situation that simultaneously positions people at heightened risk of transport and energy poverty. We investigate this 'double vulnerability' through original data collection via three nationally representative surveys of Mexico (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,205), the United Arab Emirates (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,141), Ireland and Northern Ireland (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa01,860). We draw from this original data to elaborate on the sociodemographic attributes, expenditure and behaviour emerging from energy and transport use, focusing on themes such as equity, behaviour and vulnerability. We propose energy and transport poverty indexes that allow us to summarize the key contributing factors to energy and transport poverty in the countries studied and uncover a strong correlation between these two salient forms of poverty. Our results suggest that energy and transport poverty are common issues regardless of the very different national, and even sub-national, contexts. We conclude that energy and transport poverty requires target policy interventions suitable for all segments of society, thus enabling contextually-tailored, just energy transitions.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Mobility poverty; Fuel poverty, equity; Climate policy; Energy policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Miguel Anto\\xc3\\xb1\\xc3\\xb3n, Juan Ventura Pern\\xc3\\xada-S\\xc3\\xa1nchez, Teresa Cancho-Soto, In\\xc3\\xa9s Segovia-Molina, Nuria D\\xc3\\xadez-Monge, Alfredo Cano,\\r\\n',b'Asthma control in children, socioeconomic inequality and health care,\\r\\n',b'Anales de Pediatr\\xc3\\xada (English Edition),\\r\\n',b'Volume 98, Issue 5,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'Pages 353-361,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2341-2879,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anpede.2022.12.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287923000819)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Introduction\\r\\n',b'Socioeconomic inequality (SEI) can adversely affect asthma control.

This is the case in Lagos, a megacity reportedly dominated by slum dwellers, with limited knowledge on residential choices of slum dwellers and its contribution to slum population growth. This study, therefore, investigated the movement pattern of slum dwellers, factors influencing the residential choices and reasons for the people to remain in the Lagos slums. Data was collected through questionnaires and focus group discussions in slums in Lagos. The findings show that movement to Lagos was the main cause of population growth in the slums. Furthermore, slums in Lagos serve as a sink and a final destination for slum dwellers. Also, the factors that attract most of the slum dwellers to the slums differ from those that made them wish to remain. The identified factors were based on the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents, it is therefore important for the Lagos state Government to incorporate them in their slum management policies, especially when relocation of slum dwellers is the only alternative.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Population growth; Residential decision; Slum; Lagos\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rahul Pathak, Christopher K.

Our empirical strategy relies on long-term changes in poverty and access to bus transit at the neighborhood level in the Atlanta metropolitan area. We estimate the effect of bus transit access on poverty using fixed effects models to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics. Furthermore, we undertake several robustness checks using a combination of instrumental variable regression, subsample analysis, and propensity score matching. Our results indicate that, on average, after controlling for neighborhood characteristics, census tracts with better access to public bus transportation have a higher proportion of low-income households \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in both the central city and the suburbs.

The design of effective preventive interventions is complex and requires an integrative approach from evidence-based information analyzed through robust theoretical frameworks. We conducted a systematized literature review and qualitative framework-guided thematic analysis to identify social ecological factors affecting the prevention and exposure to zoonotic diseases. Although resources for research are limited in Latin America, we found several studies with relevant results. We extracted and interpreted 8 themes as factors affecting the prevention, transmission, and exposure to zoonosis.

Although previous theories have explained the factors affecting urban renewal, such studies have failed to identify the differences among the drivers of multifunctional types of urban renewal, leading generalized urban renewal policies to fail. To extend the urban renewal theory from a typological perspective, this paper presents a study that identified the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the multifunctional types of urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China. Multisource data, such as planning permits, were used to identify the urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China, between 2010 and 2020 as well as the prerenewal and postrenewal functions of these projects. The results indicate that 1) the regression model accuracy is 60.3\\xc2\\xa0% for urban renewal as a whole. The classification of urban renewal projects improves the goodness of fit of the regression model by 0.16. 2) Land location, land prices, and policies were found to exert a greater influence on urban renewal than other factors, indicating that public demand plays a weaker role in driving urban renewal projects than the government or developers do. 3) The major types of urban renewal can be categorized into three typical driving modes: government-oriented urban renewal, which includes new industrial and public service projects; production-oriented urban renewal, which includes the conversion of industrial land into commercial or residential functions; and consumption-oriented urban renewal, including new residential projects implemented to accommodate the housing needs of an increasing population. Urban planners and policymakers can apply the results to classify urban renewal projects and adopt appropriate strategies for each type to achieve reasonable resource allocation and sustainable development.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban renewal; Spatial governance; Driving forces; Planning permit; The Rent Gap Theory\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sabyasachi Tripathi,\\r\\n',b'Do cities favor female entrepreneurs?

The National Sample Survey (NSS) unit-level data are used for the analysis. The descriptive results show that women's proprietorship is much lower than its counterpart. The Probit regression results at the individual level show that women entrepreneurs do not have a bank account or computer but use the internet, are not registered under any act or authority, and do not expand considerably. They operate within household premises with a limited number of months and duration of a day, undertaking mainly contract basis. They also face several problems that hinder their activities. City-level factors such as work participation rate, consumption expenditure, higher levels of general and technical degrees, and vocational training are essential. The likelihood of becoming a female entrepreneur is negatively impacted by the two agglomeration variables of population size and participation in mixed activity. City-level poverty and inequality also adversely affect it. State-level Human Development Index, Gender Development Index, and Gender Inequality Index are also significant. Finally, we propose important policies to enable the city environment to improve women's entrepreneurship activities for higher and sustainable economic development.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Female; Entrepreneurship; Agglomeration; Poverty; Inequality; Development; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Lirong Hu, Shenjing He, Zixuan Han, He Xiao, Shiliang Su, Min Weng, Zhongliang Cai,\\r\\n',b'Monitoring housing rental prices based on social media:An integrated approach of machine-learning algorithms and hedonic modeling to inform equitable housing policies,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 82,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 657-673,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2018.12.030.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837718316429)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: National land use policies and strategies worldwide have attempted to establish a healthy housing rental market towards urban sustainability. Monitoring fine-scale housing rental prices should provide essential implications for equitable housing policies. However, doing so remains a challenge because aggregated data were traditionally collected at a coarse scale through census or social surveys. On-line housing rental websites (OHRWs) have become popular social media platforms in the housing studies. This paper attempts to demonstrate how to monitor fine-scale housing rental prices based on OHRWs using the case of Shenzhen in China. Employing hedonic model, a set of housing rental determinants are initially selected from three characteristics (neighborhood, location and structure) and at three levels (nearest accessibility, 15-minute walking distance availability and sub-district availability). Housing rent prediction models are then established (respectively for October 2017 and February 2018) using the training samples collected from the OHRWs and six machine-learning algorithms, including random forest regression (RFR), extra-trees regression (ETR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), support vector regression (SVR), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN). Thereafter, the relative importance of the determinants is calculated and visualized using partial dependence plots. Finally, the models are used to monitor housing rental price dynamics for all of the communities within Shenzhen. Results show that all of the algorithms except SVR generally present good performance. Among them, RFR and ETR are the best one in October 2017 and February 2018, respectively. Concerning the spatial pattern of housing rental, the high-high clusters merge in the central districts, whereas the low-low clusters are located in the outskirts, and the growth rate is the greatest in the farthest outskirts from the central districts. Each determinant affects the housing rent across different scale and sub-district availability and nearest accessibility are more important than 15-minute walking distance availability. The two most influential determinants are sub-district job opportunity and nearest accessibility to health care facilities. The case of Shenzhen shows that the demonstrated framework, which integrates machine-learning algorithms and the hedonic modeling, is practical and efficient. The approach is believed to provide an essential tool to inform equitable housing policies.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Housing rental price; Social media; Hedonic model; Multilevel determinants; Machine learning; Equitable housing policies\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Courtney Queen, Derick N.

To improve electricity savings, policies oriented towards efficiency in residential consumption, such as replacement of appliances or the construction of nearly-zero energy buildings, have been suggested and implemented. However, the potential relevance of urban structural characteristics, such as the increase in detached houses in sprawling residential areas, has not often been considered. The aim of this research is to analyse the relevance of living in a detached house located in a dispersed urban area to household electricity consumption. Thus, an electricity consumption model is estimated by using household socioeconomic variables and including urban characteristics as its determinants, such us the level of urban agglomeration or whether families live in detached-sprawling homes. The model is estimated by using 2014 Household Budget Survey (HBS) microdata and applying Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) as well as quantile regressions (QR) as econometric procedures. Endogeneity problems are corrected by means of instrumental variables. The results confirm that living in a detached house significantly increases electricity consumption, whereas urban agglomerations have the opposite effect. Sprawl is occurring rapidly in Spanish cities, and according to our results, it could constitute a relevant source of increase in electricity demand in the following years.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Household energy consumption; House characteristics; Urban sprawl; Urban energy efficiency\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Hyun Kim, Dujin Park, Gyu Seomun, Hyewon Kim, Kyle Maurice Woosnam, Bong Jik Kim,\\r\\n',b'Health justice and economic segregation in climate risks: Tracing vulnerability and readiness progress,\\r\\n',b'Health & Place,\\r\\n',b'Volume 84,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'103113,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1353-8292,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2023.103113.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829223001508)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Climate vulnerability can make urban space unhealthy and accentuate existing health (in)justice and (economic) segregation.

It has become increasingly evident that the dialog must expand to include mental health outcomes, and to shift focus to the facets of the urban environment that shape them. Population-based research is necessary, as empirical findings linking the urban environment and mental health have primarily derived from developed countries, and may not be generalizable to developing countries. Thus, the current study assesses the prevalence of mental health problems (i.e., depression, perceived powerlessness), as well as their community-based predictors (i.e., crime, disorder, poverty, poor sanitation, local social capital and cohesion), among a sample of 690 residents in three poor urban communities in Accra, Ghana. It uncovers that residents in poor urban communities in developing countries suffer from mental health problems as a result of local stressors, which include not only physical and structural factors but social ones. Social capital and social cohesion show complex, often unhealthy, relationships with mental health, suggesting considerable drawbacks in making social capital a key focus among policymakers.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Mental health; Social capital; Social cohesion; Urban poverty and disorder\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Wenjie Wu, Wenzhong Zhang, Guanpeng Dong,\\r\\n',b'Determinant of residential location choice in a transitional housing market: Evidence based on micro survey from Beijing,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 39,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 16-24,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2012.10.008.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397512000719)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Using a large-scale household survey and aggregated census data from Beijing, this paper develops a framework to empirically measure the relative impact of location characteristics versus individual characteristics in determining the residential location choices of households.

In addition, while some individual socioeconomic characteristics such as income, educational attainment, and ownership status have similar effects on location choices as in developed market economies, factors that characterize institutional forces still play significant roles in residential location choices.

Land Use (LU) and Land Cover (LC) are two types of cartographic data that are used to develop smart cities and monitor the environment. LULC classification can benefit greatly from successfully applying remote sensing Image Classification (IC) using high spatial resolution data. The acquisition of spatiotemporal data for LULC classification has been made more accessible because of recent improvements in spatial analysis and Deep Learning (DL) technology. Considering the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in related Computer Vision (CV) tasks and the enormous volume of remotely sensed data accessible, DL methods appear to be particularly promising for modelling many remote sensing problems. However, there are several issues with ground-truth, resolution, and the nature of data that have a significant impact on categorization performance. We propose a Reversible Residual Network (RAVNet), a hybrid residual attention sensitive segmentation approach, to precisely categorize LULC in this study. The suggested network is based on the VNet model, which extracts relevant information by mixing low-level and high-level Feature Maps (FM). The attention-aware features change adaptively to the integration of residual modules. Our system was tested on the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset, and the findings demonstrate that our architecture is competitive against other learning models.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Land use and land cover; Classification; Machine learning; Deep learning; RAVNet; Spatial analysis; Accuracy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gideon Baffoe, Sohail Ahmad, Ramjee Bhandari,\\r\\n',b'The road to sustainable Kigali: A contextualized analysis of the challenges,\\r\\n',b'Cities,\\r\\n',b'Volume 105,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'102838,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2020.102838.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275120311860)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Rwanda, despite being a predominantly rural country, has remarkably performed in the post-conflict (late 1990s) period on the socio-economic fronts. Contemporary challenges in Rwanda's capital city, Kigali, are widespread informality, both in the economy and urban built environment. Informality significantly hinders human health and wellbeing attainment. This paper assesses the development trajectory of Kigali with reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using mixed research methods, including field visit. In doing so, the study dwells on three theories; postcolonial urbanism, post-conflict state building and neoliberalism. The paper diagnoses informality, polarized health sector and governance, as critical limitations to the attainment of sustainable development in Kigali. It argues that urban development in post-conflict Kigali is deeply rooted in capitalist and neoliberal ideology, where the state functions as the architect and facilitator of wealth accumulation for the few elites. Based on the analyses of the current development patterns, inclusive governance is identified as a key intervention to achieve sustainable development in Kigali.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Kigali; Urbanisation; Health; Governance; SDG; Post-conflict urbanism\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Md.

This paper highlights that the urban poor living in diverse forms of settlements in Bangladesh are making use of micro-credit from NGOs for housing-related upgrading activities that is not officially targeted for housing microfinance, but for supporting livelihood strategies. Another model of housing finance presented in this paper is community group savings programme which has been operationalised in Bangladesh over the last few years and promoted especially through the urban development projects by international agencies. This paper is an attempt to identify the salient features of these two provisions of finance in low-income urban settlements of Bangladesh. The paper follows a tradition of research in understanding different modes of housing provision of the urban poor that is related with the access to different form of finance to improve the housing condition of the urban poor. To do so two different cases from Gopalganj and Khulna city are presented, analysed and compared to deepen the understanding of how housing finance is operationalised in practice.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Housing finance; Micro-credit; Group savings; Urban poverty; Bangladesh\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Suranjan Majumder, Subham Roy, Arghadeep Bose, Indrajit Roy Chowdhury,\\r\\n',b'Multiscale GIS based-model to assess urban social vulnerability and associated risk: Evidence from 146 urban centers of Eastern India,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 96,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'104692,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2023.104692.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670723003037)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Social vulnerability in this study is expressed by highlighting the different forms of social deprivation experienced by the urban inhabitants. This article proposes a fundamental approach to quantify social vulnerability and associated risk in urban areas. Here, urban social vulnerability (USoV) consists of three interconnected dimensions, i.e. exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Based on these three dimensions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the urban social vulnerability index (USoVI) was computed using 15 indicators. Therefore, using the GIS environment, a composite measure is applied to identify and map the spatial heterogeneity of USoV for the 146 urban centres in Eastern India. The results highlight that most urban locations experience moderate to high exposure, sensitivity and low adaptive capacity corresponding to high USoV. Moran's I result indicates that the adaptive capacity shows the largest spatial association, while sensitivity indicates the lowest Moran value with the least association.

Literature remarks that social capital seems to contribute to the endurance of such livelihoods, although the underlying mechanisms through which this capital operates in such context remain under-researched. This paper uses the example of fifteen ejidos located in a peripheral municipality notably affected by the expansion of Morelia, a middle size city in Michoac\\xc3\\xa1n, Mexico, to explore such mechanisms. Two main considerations were taken into account to fulfill this purpose. First, we assumed that social capital is the result of a social construction process, so it is the product of formal and informal institutionalized social relationships that promote feed-back loops of social engagement, trust and reciprocity that help to mobilize meaningful resources for mutual benefit. Second, we focused on the ejido as the unit of analysis since it is considered as one of the most important forms of social organization in the rural Mexico. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with their respective Comisariados ejidale\\xc5\\x9b presidents. Results show how ejidatarios engage and reciprocate inside the ejido. Also, they reveal the nature of the exchanges and their outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of local institutional and non-institutional arrangements in regulating access to, and distribution of, resources in peri-urban territories.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Social Capital; periurbanization; agricultural livelihoods; ejidos; peri-urban poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rishabh Kumar, Sriram Balasubramanian, Prakash Loungani,\\r\\n',b'Inequality and locational determinants of the distribution of living standards in India,\\r\\n',b'Structural Change and Economic Dynamics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 61,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'Pages 59-69,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0954-349X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2022.02.007.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0954349X22000169)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: We analyze consumption distribution in India purely on the basis of location \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a combination of the state and sector (urban, rural) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and find that it explains a third of the variation in living standards. Consumption is also shown to be positively related to locational inequality. The main reason is that in poorer locations, consumption is tightly (less unequally) distributed around a low level, making class a poor predictor of higher living standards compared to the aggregate. In effect, from an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective, living standards are higher in richer, but more unequal, locations in India. We analyze these paradoxes as evidence of an ongoing Kuznets type processes. Our results have implications for the persistence of economic migration within a fast-growing emerging economy.

It does so by describing challenges and opportunities for intervening to address these social determinants, and by presenting some potential approaches to the choice, design and evaluation of such interventions, especially in low and middle-income countries. Challenges include distal interventions, limits to the modifiability of some social and economic determinants, poorly understood mechanisms, difficulty defining the boundaries of such interventions, the need for inter-disciplinary and inter-sectoral collaboration, limited datasets in LMIC, sample size challenges for prevention interventions, ethical issues and siloed research funding. Potential approaches include the development of more robust causal models, trial designs that allow for analysis of mechanisms and the pooling of data across diverse settings to explore the role of contextual variables. Several criteria can inform the selection of interventions that target social determinants and these include the need for plausible mechanisms, feasibility, acceptability, cultural validity of moderator, mediator and outcome variables, generalizability and sustainability. These approaches require a high level of inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary cooperation and data sharing across sites internationally.

We provide both an in-depth exploration and analysis of the travel patterns and preferences of Nairobi residents and a discussion of the implications of these results for transport policy in this city. The data show that the lack of suitable transport infrastructure exacerbates travel challenges for residents across all income groups. A substantial portion of the local population cannot regularly afford any form of motorized transportation. They thus are forced to locate in slums near sources of employment, and the widespread lack of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure increases the risk that they face when traveling. The middle income group who cannot afford private cars is almost completely dependent on the informal public transport system, which provides good geographic service coverage at the expense of service quality. Approximately 15% of Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s households own cars. Our analysis shows that without policies that make non-motorized transport safer and public transport service better, car ownership and use will increase sharply as the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residents become wealthier, further congesting already-overloaded roadways.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Africa; Public transport; Travel survey; Logit model\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n',b'3 - Interactions between obesity, economic growth, globalisation, urbanisation and poverty in Latin American and Caribbean countries,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n',b'Obesity Epidemic and the Environment,\\r\\n',b'Academic Press,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'Pages 45-87,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780323993395,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-99339-5.00005-4.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323993395000054)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This chapter focuses on the determinants of obesity and the interactions between these determinants and obesity. The main determinants considered are urbanisation, globalisation, poverty, and economic growth. A reinforcing effect is expected to be found between these determinants and obesity, so evidence of the nutritional transition in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries is expected. Using data collected for 23 LAC countries from 1990 to 2016 and estimating a panel vector autoregression (PVAR) model regression, the results confirm the initial hypotheses. An increase in the prevalence of obesity is related to the rise of urbanisation, globalisation and poverty reduction, and it is also interrelated with economic growth.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Econometrics; Economic growth; Globalisation; Health economics; Income; Macroeconomics; Obesity; Poverty; Urbanisation\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dauda Ayuba, Anna Yunana Akinga, Debra Ukamaka Okeh, Jerico B.

This has consequently led to an increase in urban poverty. The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of migration on rural and urban areas, challenges of urbanization, and food security of the urban poor, as well as to suggest ways to address the dilemma of the urban poor in Nigeria. This research consists of analytical work based on a survey of existing literature. The study observed that insecurity and conflicts are major drivers of rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban migration and a root cause of food insecurity; consequently, leading to urban poverty. It is suggested that government should as a matter of urgency address insecurity and conflict in order to arrest rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban migration, boost food security and reduce poverty in the country.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Food security; Urbanization; Urban Poor; Nigeria\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Alexandra Wollum, Sof\\xc3\\xada Gardu\\xc3\\xb1o Huerta, Oriana L\\xc3\\xb3pez Uribe, Camille Garnsey, S.

Abortion accompaniment, in the form of logistical, informational, and emotional support offered by individuals and organizations, takes a person-centered, feminist, and rights-based approach. We tested the extent to which abortion accompaniment may decrease negative and increase positive feelings an individual holds related to their abortion. Using observational longitudinal data collected between January 2017 and mid-2018, we compared negative and positive emotional responses to a personal abortion experience one month and six months following the abortion to emotions immediately prior to the abortion (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbaseline\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), among women travelling from outside of Mexico City to abortion clinics in Mexico City with and without support of the accompaniment organization, Fondo MARIA. We used doubly robust longitudinal mixed effects models with inverse probability weighting methods. At baseline, accompanied and unaccompanied participants experienced an average of 4.9 and 4.4 negative emotions out of eight respectively (i.e., anguish, nervousness, scared, anxious, sadness, guilt, anger, shame) and 1.7 and 1.9 positive emotions of out 4 respectively (happiness, calmness, decidedness, and relief). From our model results, women accompanied (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa077) had larger decreases in negative feelings (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.05) and larger increases in positive feelings (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa0.01) toward their abortion compared to those who were not accompanied (n\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0119) at six months. These changes led the majority of accompanied respondents to have primarily positive feelings about their abortion by endline. Abortion accompaniment through Fondo MARIA in Mexico City was associated with a larger decrease in negative feelings, particularly those related to stigma, and a larger increase in positive feelings six months after abortion. Accompaniment's focus on person-centered support, self-determination, and autonomy may enable people seeking abortion to view their decision as one that is valid and legitimate, and resist the predominant stigmatizing narratives framing abortion as something that is transgressive.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Abortion; Accompaniment; Mexico; Emotions; Abortion stigma; Person-centered care\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sumila Gulyani, Debabrata Talukdar,\\r\\n',b'Inside Informality: The Links Between Poverty, Microenterprises, and Living Conditions in Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 38, Issue 12,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1710-1726,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2010.06.013.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X1000118X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Using households rather than enterprises as the analytical unit, this study of 1,755 households in Nairobi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slums reveals that informal household microenterprises are indeed helping offset poverty.

National policies to fight unhealthy eating have been implemented but they don't target social and family environment determinants. Our study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the determinants of unhealthy eating by exploring the perspectives and experiences of low-income Mexican women with a young child at home. We conducted a purposeful sampling to include participating kindergartens in Morelos, M\\xc3\\xa9xico. Women with a child enrolled in the kindergarten were invited to focus group discussions. Afterward, women with specific profiles were invited to in-depth interviews. During analysis we applied Dahlgren and Whitehead's model of social determinants of health (SDH). Overall, we found that participants have unhealthy habits, for example: low variability in consumption patterns, regular sugar-sweetened beverages intake and insufficient fruit and vegetable intake. By low variability we mean frequently consumed products (on most days of the week) limited to a restricted food set. As for the determinants of unhealthy habits, we found at the community level that families encourage unhealthy eating. At the household and work level, tight schedules for food preparation determine unhealthy eating. And, at a socio-economic level, lack of access and money constraints shape unhealthy habits. Unhealthy habits are determined by factors on multiple levels and using an SDH approach can be an effective way to inform comprehensive strategies targeting the overweight and obesity epidemic in Mexico and other low- and middle-income countries.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Unhealthy habits; Eating habits; Social determinants\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Singumbe Muyeba,\\r\\n',b'Institutional capital, urban poverty and household wealth in Cape Town,\\r\\n',b'World Development Perspectives,\\r\\n',b'Volume 16,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'100139,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2452-2929,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wdp.2019.100139.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452292919300013)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article identifies factors that explain urban poverty by focusing on the relationship between institutional capital and household wealth in Cape Town.

Although there is a concrete association with hunger, malnutrition doesn't always imply hunger or famine and is manifest in many forms, from chronic hunger to micronutrient deficiency, and from stunting to obesity. Key determinants triggering malnutrition encompass excessive intakes, insufficient food consumption or inadequate utilization of nutrients provided by foods that are consumed. Undernutrition is a term that includes stunting, underweight, wasting and having deficient levels of essential vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients). As such, it constitutes the malnutrition category that represents nutrient deficits. The other form of malnutrition is associated with excessive energy and nutrient intakes (which may also be accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies or suboptimal intakes), leading to obesity and other diet related non-communicable diseases. This article focuses on undernutrition and the triple burden that many countries face in dealing with both under and overnutrition.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Food security; Malnutrition; Micronutrient deficiency; Moderate acute malnutrition; Severe acute malnutrition; Stunting; Sustainable development; Undernourishment; Undernutrition; Triple burden\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mesele Belay Zegeye, Getamesay Bekele Meshesha, Muhammad Ibrahim Shah,\\r\\n',b'Measuring the poverty reduction effects of adopting agricultural technologies in rural Ethiopia: findings from an endogenous switching regression approach,\\r\\n',b'Heliyon,\\r\\n',b'Volume 8, Issue 5,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'e09495,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2405-8440,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09495.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022007836)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: The purpose of this study is to understand how the adoption of different agricultural technologies can reduce poverty in rural regions of Ethiopia. To attain this objective, this paper uses a comprehensive socio-economic survey of Ethiopia, which allows us to securitize the household level information. The paper uses a multinomial endogenous switching regression model to estimate the impact of alternative technologies adoption on poverty reduction on a sample of 2316 farm households, and a multinomial logit model to estimate the determinants of alternative agricultural technologies adoption. The results showed that the decision to adopt alternative agricultural technologies depends on several variables such as education, regional heterogeneity, remittance income, extension visit, credit access, off-farm activity, soil quality, farm size, tropical livestock unit, distance, plot's potential wetness, and ownership certification. The impact results of the study show that household consumption increases when households adopt alternative agricultural technologies, thereby reducing their poverty. Furthermore, adoption of a package of technologies can result in higher food and total consumption per adult than single technology adoption. The paper recommends strategies for further disseminating and scaling up these technologies to help reduce poverty in Ethiopia.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Agricultural technology; Rural Ethiopia; Poverty; Multinomial logit; Endogenous switching model\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Antonio Rodr\\xc3\\xadguez Andr\\xc3\\xa9s, Bidisha Chakraborty, Piyali Dasgupta, Siddhartha Mitra,\\r\\n',b'Realizing the significance of socio-economic triggers for mental health outcomes in India,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Economics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 50,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 50-57,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2214-8043,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2014.03.002.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214804314000366)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of socio-economic triggers on mental health outcomes, proxied by male and female suicide rates.

Moreover, the white working-class has experienced a surge in socio-cultural isolation, and disengagement with societal institutions. This analysis focuses on the health consequences of these developments, with a particular emphasis on the rising \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeaths of despair\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (suicide, drug poisoning, alcohol related). These deaths have been increasing since the mid-1990s and, at least until recently, tended to be clustered amongst whites without a four-year college degree. Various competing explanations have been put forth, emphasizing distinct factors such as material conditions, socio-cultural dynamics, and accessibility to opioids. Using a series of linear models this analysis examines the county-level association between economic precarity, white working-class population size, opioid accessibility, and deaths of despair. Results affirm the net effect of each predictor and illuminate an interactive relationship between opioid accessibility and precarity, as well as an interactive relationship between all three predictors.

Using the theory of new institutional economics, this paper aims to answer two questions: what informal institutions secure the de facto tenure and facilitate the market? and How do informal institutions affect the pricing mechanism? We propose a conceptual framework to investigate the links between informal institutions, de facto tenure, and the price of informal housing. It is argued that villages have the ability to seek political patronage and regulate the market transactions to secure the tenure of informal housing. This ability is authorized by several formalities: the dual land system and the regime of village autonomy. The growing powers of market agencies in local development help strengthen the village's ability. The variances in ability between villages lead to a heterogeneity of tenure security, thus creating price differentials in the market. A higher tenure security increases the housing price. In conclusion, the informal housing market in China is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csemi-formal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system in which both informality and formality work and intertwine.

Yet, medical trainees remain underprepared to address the social determinants of health in practice, despite curricular innovations. Therefore, there is a critical need to explore how social determinants of health curricula is taken up by medical students. This study, which draws upon ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews at a medical school in the United States, explores how medical students understand their role in addressing social determinants of health. I find that epistemic invulnerability, defined as the closure to affect or to be affected in relation to others, generates feelings of helplessness, closure to alternate possibilities, and rigid professional boundaries that prevent medical students from incorporating the responsibility to act on the social determinants into their clinical purview. These findings provide novel epistemological context to better align health equity curricula in medical education with the aim to train physicians that both understand and address the social determinants of health.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Medical education; Epistemic invulnerability; Professional socialization; Health equity; Social determinants of health\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Laura Rodriguez-Takeuchi, Katsushi S.

In the olden days, most peop le were poor, and this was accepted as natural and unavoidable. The current understanding, on the contrary, is that the condition of poverty is unacceptable, and that it should be eradicated. This study investigates the impact of food security on urban poverty using Lagos state, Nigeria as a case study. The study reveals that four important proxies (high level of education, small household size, healthy households and high income,) for food security have huge impact on poverty and significant impact on urban poverty.

Literature on the interface of inner-city rearing, sustainable cities and urban governance dilemma is limited in African cities. Using the city of Wa in Ghana as a case, this study seeks to understand cattle-rearing practices, driving forces, the public health risk and governance challenges in African cities. The study employed a questionnaire to elicit data from 96 cattle keepers, while interviews were conducted with neighborhood residents and city authorities. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze the quantitative data, and thematic analysis employed to analyze the qualitative data. The study found that cattle keepers are spread across the inner-city and keep indigenous, exotic, and crossbreeds. Open grazing and stall feeding were adopted in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The animals are kept in makeshift structures and open kraals. The holders earn substantial income, making demand for cattle the main determinant of farmers' decision to rear. Although the cattle pose a health risk and cause inconvenience to residents, political interferences and logistical constraints limit local authority's efforts to govern rearing in the inner-city. Based on the challenges and the benefits, city authorities might be faced with trying to strike a balance with sustainable cities' agenda. Therefore, actions towards harmony between livestock rearing, environmental sustainability and human safety are imperative for effective urban governance.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Livestock; Cattle; Sustainable cities; Urban governance; Ghana\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Abdul Latif Alhassan, Nicholas Biekpe,\\r\\n',b'Determinants of life insurance consumption in Africa,\\r\\n',b'Research in International Business and Finance,\\r\\n',b'Volume 37,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 17-27,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0275-5319,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ribaf.2015.10.016.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027553191530057X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: We take motivation from the low insurance penetration in Africa to investigate the factors that influence life insurance consumption in 31 African countries from 1996 to 2010.

Fuels use in developing countries is heterogeneous across households. This paper estimates drivers of fuel switching in non-slum and slum households in urban India, using a discrete choice model on a nationally representative micro data. The choices considered are three categories of cooking fuels: traditional \\xe2\\x80\\x93 firewood, dung, crop residue and coal/charcoal; modern \\xe2\\x80\\x93 kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG); and mixed fuels. The results suggest that the patterns of fuels use are consistent with the energy ladder theory in urban India. In addition to income, the major determinants of modern fuels uptake are fuels prices, access to electricity and water supply, and education attainment. The increasing price of LPG affects the willingness to change fuels for low-income non-slum and the high-income slum households negatively. The analyses make a strong case for applying differential subsidies on modern fuels employing multidimensional aspects of poverty. Moreover, there is a need for partial diversion of existing fuels subsidies on improving physical and social capitals, which will result in uptake of modern fuels, particularly among disadvantaged communities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Cooking energy; Fuel switching; LPG; Slum; India\\r\\n',b'Sonia Alejandra Pou, Natalia Tumas, David S\\xc3\\xa1nchez Soria, Pablo Ortiz, Mar\\xc3\\xada del Pilar D\\xc3\\xadaz,\\r\\n',b'Large-scale societal factors and noncommunicable diseases: Urbanization, poverty and mortality spatial patterns in Argentina,\\r\\n',b'Applied Geography,\\r\\n',b'Volume 86,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 32-40,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0143-6228,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2017.06.022.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622816302351)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Introduction\\r\\n',b'In developing countries, the rapid increase in noncommunicable diseases burden has been accompanied by socio-demographic changes, such as rapid urbanization, with persistence of considerable socio-economic gaps between populations.

This article reviews the use of data in nonprofit organizations, including the types of data collected and accessed, the motivations for data capture, and the barriers to systematic use of data. The literature shows that nonprofit organizations capture a variety of data, including public and financial data, performance measures, program evaluation data, and volunteer information. Organizations use these with diverse motivations such as program or organizational improvement, marketing, and accountability. Prominent barriers faced by organizations include challenges in identifying meaningful information, lack of technical ability, inability to prioritize data work, as well as external influences. The article highlights the challenges in synthesizing the available literature, with a high degree of fragmentation, including research from distinct intellectual traditions resulting in many disconnected constructs, measurements, and theories.

This research finds the positive prospects for low-income neighborhood households to move up, while the characteristics (e.g., racial composition) of origin and destination neighborhoods play a significant role in relocation outcomes. In addition, housing mobility programs can have various impacts on households moving from neighborhoods of different income levels. Policymakers should be aware of the diverse needs of households in extremely low-income neighborhoods (less concentrated housing assistance) and in very low-income neighborhoods (public housing) that can help them move out of concentrated poverty and move up to neighborhoods with higher income spectrums.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Low-income neighborhood; Housing policy; Poverty; Urban governance\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jose G.

In this study, we proposed the use of online rental listings as a new reliable data source for mapping housing rent. With the collected individual rental information from an online platform, we attempted to produce the fine-scale spatial pattern of housing rent in the metropolitan area of Guangzhou, China, at the neighborhood committee (NC) level. This involves the task of estimating the housing rent for areas with no observation data of housing rent. To this end, we evaluated six numeric prediction methods of machine learning. We further enhanced their performance through ensemble learning, an approach which can form new classifiers with even better performance than any of the individual constituent classifiers. We implemented ensemble learning through ways of bagging and stacking, and selected the most accurate ensemble classifier to produce the spatial pattern of housing rent at the NC-level. In the resulting housing rent pattern, we identified a distance decay relationship between the housing rent and the distance from the city center. The data sources and the ensemble learning platform in this application of housing rent mapping are generally open access. Therefore, the proposed approach in this study can provide useful hints for housing rent mapping in other geographical areas. Our mapping results can also be integrated with additional information to support the studies of urban residential problems in China.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Housing rent mapping; Online rental listings; Anjuke; Ensemble learning\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Moritz U.G.

Important advances in data quality and methodologies have allowed for better investigation of disease risk and its association with environmental factors. However, incorporating dynamic human behavioural processes in disease mapping remains challenging. For example, connectivity among human populations, a key driver of pathogen dispersal, has increased sharply over the past century, along with the availability of data derived from mobile phones and other dynamic data sources. Future work must be targeted towards the rapid updating and dissemination of appropriately designed disease maps to guide the public health community in reducing the global burden of infectious disease.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: spatial epidemiology; mapping; disease modelling; pathogen dispersal; human mobility\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Nicola Dempsey, Mel Burton,\\r\\n',b'Defining place-keeping: The long-term management of public spaces,\\r\\n',b'Urban Forestry & Urban Greening,\\r\\n',b'Volume 11, Issue 1,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 11-20,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1618-8667,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2011.09.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866711000732)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: There has long been a focus in urban landscape planning and design on the creation of highquality public spaces, or place-making. Large amounts of capital continue to be spent on creating such spaces without adequate thought or resources for their long-term maintenance and management of public spaces, or place-keeping. While there may be continued policy rhetoric about the importance of place-keeping, particularly as public spaces are recognised for their important contribution to health, wellbeing, biodiversity and also their economic value, this has not however been supported in practice. There are examples in many cities where public spaces are subject to poor management and maintenance practices. This is clearly visible where vandalism, litter and damage to facilities and equipment occur, and people no longer feel safe or comfortable. This paper argues that this uneven focus on place-keeping is not only due to a lack of resources but also a lack of understanding of the concept, its complexity and the wide implications it has for users, practitioners and policymakers. The paper aims to address this gap in knowledge by providing a detailed exploration and definition of place-keeping within the urban context. Place-keeping is not simply about the physical environment, its design and maintenance, but also encompasses the interrelated and non-physical dimensions of partnerships, governance, funding, policy and evaluation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Design; Landscape; Maintenance; Place-making; Planning; Urban\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Abbas El-Zein, Samer Jabbour, Belgin Tekce, Huda Zurayk, Iman Nuwayhid, Marwan Khawaja, Tariq Tell, Yusuf Al Mooji, Jocelyn De-Jong, Nasser Yassin, Dennis Hogan,\\r\\n',b'Health and ecological sustainability in the Arab world: a matter of survival,\\r\\n',b'The Lancet,\\r\\n',b'Volume 383, Issue 9915,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 458-476,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0140-6736,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62338-7.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613623387)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Discussions leading to the Rio+20 UN conference have emphasised the importance of sustainable development and the protection of the environment for future generations. The Arab world faces large-scale threats to its sustainable development and, most of all, to the viability and existence of the ecological systems for its human settlements. The dynamics of population change, ecological degradation, and resource scarcity, and development policies and practices, all occurring in complex and highly unstable geopolitical and economic environments, are fostering the poor prospects. In this report, we discuss the most pertinent population\\xe2\\x80\\x93environment\\xe2\\x80\\x93development dynamics in the Arab world, and the two-way interactions between these dynamics and health, on the basis of current data. We draw attention to trends that are relevant to health professionals and researchers, but emphasise that the dynamics generating these trends have implications that go well beyond health. We argue that the current discourse on health, population, and development in the Arab world has largely failed to convey a sense of urgency, when the survival of whole communities is at stake. The dismal ecological and development records of Arab countries over the past two decades call for new directions. We suggest that regional ecological integration around exchange of water, energy, food, and labour, though politically difficult to achieve, offers the best hope to improve the adaptive capacity of individual Arab nations. The transformative political changes taking place in the Arab world offer promise, indeed an imperative, for such renewal. We call on policy makers, researchers, practitioners, and international agencies to emphasise the urgency and take action.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kalpana Gopalan, Madalasa Venkataraman,\\r\\n',b'Affordable housing: Policy and practice in India,\\r\\n',b'IIMB Management Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 27, Issue 2,\\r\\n',b'2015,\\r\\n',b'Pages 129-140,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0970-3896,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iimb.2015.03.003.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0970389615000336)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Affordable housing is a problem that many countries are taking stock of, world over.

However, educational decision-making may be sensitive to contextual factors such as economic deprivation, a dysfunctional welfare state or poor access to credit markets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 characteristics shared by most low- and middle-income countries. To better understand how economically disadvantaged individuals in developing countries make their educational choices, we conducted a survey based on a random sample with high school students in the rural department Moraz\\xc3\\xa1n in El Salvador, a lower middle-income country in Latin America. Our results show that regardless of the social background, almost all students aspire to pursue tertiary education, probably due to the high tertiary degree premium in earnings and the high social benefits. However, the lack of possibilities to finance their studies generally prevents the realisation of these aspirations for lower social background students. While in high-income countries, cost factors are not very important in the decision-making process, the burden of costs explains around 45 percent of the social background effect in El Salvador. Other factors such as academic confidence, expected future economic benefits, parental status maintenance wish, individual risk aversion and time discounting preferences play only a minor role.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Educational decision-making; Rational choice model; Tertiary education; Developing countries; Economic deprivation; Secondary effects of social origin\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Luisa M.

Based on an original dataset of 15,279 low-income households, this paper studies the incidence and determinants of illegality in the context of low-income urban favelas. The probability of engaging in illegal behavior is explained not just by low income, but by a combination of concurring factors: sub-standard energy provision and equipment; inefficient/incorrect use of domestic electric appliances and running an informal in-house business. These recurrent issues in the urban favelas aggravate a sense of exclusion from growth, which is generally recognized as a trigger of illegality. The impact of energy demand on energy-related illegality is carefully analyzed, and different empirical strategies adopted to circumvent some simultaneity problem between both decision processes. The effectiveness of consumption-based energy subsidies is also explored. In spite of some contrary arguments in the literature, in the context of peri-urban slums, such measures may exert a positive impact in mitigating illegal access and use of energy. Effectiveness will be enhanced by accompanying measures such as: perceivable improvements of equipment, metering and maintenance, promotion of beneficiaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of energy usage, and energy-saving behaviors.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slum electrification; Energy consumption subsidies; Illegal electricity connections\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Nijika Shrivastwa, Brenda W.

Urban growth is less rapid than often assumed and consumption rather than production driven, while liberalized trade regimes have globalized food systems. Urban insecurity and rural poverty are handled through self-provisioning arrangements in both rural and urban areas, which may undermine the role of urban areas as sources of demand for rural produce. Smallholders in rural areas close to existing urban areas are likely to benefit most from growing markets for high value products. Food security must be the priority for marginal areas untouched by urbanization.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urbanization; Sub-Saharan Africa; Smallholders; Rural urban linkages; Food security\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Nancy Mock, Gaurav Singhal, William Olander, Jean-Baptiste Pasquier, Nathan Morrow,\\r\\n',b'mVAM: A New Contribution to the Information Ecology of Humanitarian Work,\\r\\n',b'Procedia Engineering,\\r\\n',b'Volume 159,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 217-221,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1877-7058,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.08.164.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816323128)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This paper reviews the World Food Program's experience using mobile cellular technology to monitor food insecurity in humanitarian settings.

While such approaches have either been resisted or condemned by affected households, state and city authorities have defended them as the most appropriate remedies. Have flood events been properly understood? Are flood management approaches aimed at addressing the problem? What are the actual effects of current flood management practices? In responding to these questions, this study seeks to: (i) examine the contours and politics of managing flood vulnerability in the city (ii) understand the factors that have shaped city government's responses to flood events; and (iii) explore the challenges within the current institutional and legal arrangements for flood management. Using Agbogbloshie and Old Fadama \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the largest slum communities in Accra - as cases, the study adopts mixed qualitative methods including: interviews of flood victims, focus group discussions, institutional consultations and review of government documents in gathering relevant empirical data. The study reveals that flood management approaches have been shaped by a complex network of actors with entrenched interests.

Using monthly data over the past decade, we estimate models of inflation to identify the importance of the factors contributing to CPI inflation and three of its major components: cereal prices, food prices, and non-food prices. Our main finding is that movements in international food and goods prices, measured in domestic currency, determined the long-run evolution of domestic prices. In the short run, agricultural supply shocks affected food inflation, causing large deviations from long-run price trends. Monetary policy seems to have accommodated price shocks, but money supply growth affected short-run non-food price inflation. Our results suggest that when analyzing inflation in developing economies with a large food share in consumer prices, world food prices and domestic agricultural production should be considered. Omitting these factors can lead to biased results and misguided policy decisions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Commodity prices; Ethiopia; Food policy; Food prices; Global food price crisis; Monetary policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'James Nguyen H.

The level of housing investment is measured through the type of physical structure of the house, or more specifically, floor materials. Cluster-robust standard error logistic regression method is utilized to explore this relationship in order to fix the issue of households located in the same settlement being correlated with each other. The results show that houses with greater tenure security, whether owner-occupied or rented out, are more likely than houses with insecure tenure to have cement floors, which are more permanent and expensive than other types of floors like bamboo, wood, or dirt/mud. Importantly, renters are more likely than owner-occupants to have cement floors. In sum, although greater tenure security may positively impact housing investment, the market force in which housing is seen as a business opportunity may be an equally strong factor in encouraging investment even in poor communities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Tenure security; Housing investment; Bangladesh; Real estate; Property rights\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Adeladza Kofi Amegah, Jouni J.K.

As a critical health exposure, social integration may be one important mechanism by which places affect health. This paper brings together research on two previously studied contextual determinants of social integration. Specifically, we use multi-level data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Survey to investigate the relationships between an individual's length of residence and measures of social integration. We then investigate the extent to which these relationships are moderated by neighborhood poverty. We find that the relationship between length of residence and some measures of social integration are stronger in poor neighborhoods than in more affluent ones.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Residential stability; Social support; Neighborhood poverty; Urban policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Woojin Kang, Katsushi S.

It draws on three rounds of national household surveys in 2002, 2004 and 2006. It is first observed that the pace of poverty reduction for minorities surpassed the majority over the period 2002\\xe2\\x80\\x932006, although poor people were still concentrated in the minority groups throughout the period. Secondly, the disparity in living standards has been widening. In particular, inequality within both the majority and minority groups increased over the period. Thirdly, the study shows that the effect of economic growth on poverty is estimated to have been greater if inequality remained constant. It is also noted that the impacts of economic growth on poverty vary across different ethnic groups. Finally, regression decompositions of within inequality have confirmed that the main driver of inequality is not the same among ethnic groups. Given the diversity across different ethnic groups, we can conclude that government policy aimed at equal access to infrastructure and more equal distribution of assets, such as land, for ethnic minority groups would lead to more equal distribution of consumption and poverty reduction of those groups. Also, consideration of local needs would be necessary in designing and implementing public policies, given the heterogeneous socio-economic circumstances surrounding each ethnic minority group.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Vietnam; Ethnic minority; Growth; Poverty; Inequality; Decomposition\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David B.

Transport-related mortality will increase as a result of inadequate transport infrastructure, air pollution and sedentary lifestyles. Health Impact Assessments (HIAs) have proven to be a successful tool to predict and mitigate negative health impact of urban transport planning policies, programmes or projects. Yet, there is a gap of evidence on transport and health in African countries. The aim of this study is assessing the health impacts of transport scenarios in Port Louis (city of 119,018 inhabitants in Mauritius) using a full chain participatory HIA model.\\r\\n',b'Methods\\r\\n',b'We estimated health and economic impacts associated to transport scenarios with qualitative data and quantitative comparative risk assessment methods. The health impact modeling was based on differences between the baseline and three transport scenarios (worse, good, ideal), estimating the averted deaths per year and economic outcomes by assessing health determinants of air pollution (AP), traffic deaths and physical activity (PA). Data on air pollution and traffic fatalities were obtained from public data sources. Data used to construct scenarios, establish baseline travel mode shares and physical activity were collected through (a) open-ended individual interviews (IDIs) with 14 stakeholders (b) closed-ended survey questions to 600 citizens and (c) 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with the same 14 stakeholders from (a).\\r\\n',b'Results\\r\\n',b'In Port Louis, the worse-case transport scenario (doubling in car trips and a reduction in walking, motorcycle, and public transport), resulted in a total increment of 3.28 premature deaths per year.

Since Pakistan's energy production is mostly fossil fuel-based, the recent natural gas discoveries could potentially impact local industries and poverty. The past research has not explored the association between Trade, Poverty and Natural Gas production; therefore, this study investigates a nexus between trade, natural gas, and poverty in Pakistan for the period 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x932018. We applied the simultaneous equation method for data analysis. The results of the study suggest that trade liberalization and natural gas both increase industrial production, which, in turn, reduces the level of poverty in the country. Therefore, the government needs to further strengthen trade ties with neighbor countries and encourage the discovery of natural gas exploration to overcome ongoing energy shortage. Additionally, the government should find alternate sources of energy, like solar energy and wind energy.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Trade; Natural gas; Poverty; Pakistan\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sara McLafferty,\\r\\n',b'Spatial Mismatch,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

However, its cities are also settings for numerous struggles over future developments coupled with excess urban risks. The nexus created by the relationship between urbanization, urban growth, urban governance, poverty and inequality, and ecological degradation is altering the sustainability of urban tourism in Sub-Saharan African cities. Inspired by the United Nations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 11; making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, this study critically analyses the linkages between risk, justice, inclusion, trust and power relations in urban spaces with the aim to strengthen tourism governance in Sub-Saharan African urban settings. Document analysis is adopted to draw evidence and critically analyse the sustainability of tourism in the three Sub-Saharan cities: Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Harare, Zimbabwe. The study reveals that tourism development in Africa is dominantly underpinned by neoliberal development strategies which threaten the sustainability of tourism in African cities.

Using household (n=427 in 2006, 2009 and 2012) total income panel data sets, with and without environmental income, from Nepal, we analysed the importance of environmental income in household-level poverty assessments (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke indices) and dynamics (movements in the Poverty Transition Matrix). Random effects logit and ordered logit models were applied to estimate variables covarying with poverty categories and compared for annual household incomes with and without environmental income. Using the without environmental income data set significantly changed the number of households classified as poor, as well as rates of movements in and out of poverty. Excluding household-level environmental income also distorted estimation of covariates of poverty incidence and poverty dynamics. Poverty incidence and dynamics models including environmental income perform better than those without.

Eradicating poverty is among the priorities of the national government that aims at EU candidacy and accession. Being the most dynamic among agricultural sectors, berry farming is a key agricultural activity at the national level and had been the subject of rural development interventions, including the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This article provides evidence from the largest agricultural cooperative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to inform decision making and policy planning. The article aims at describing and analyzing the status and dynamics of poverty at the farm household level while highlighting their contributing factors, as well as at proposing possible development strategies based on the voice of local actors. Given the complexity and multifaceted features of the investigated issues, the methodological approach of this study relies on a mixed-methods research design, where the quantitative findings from the analysis of poverty status and dynamics and their contributing factors are complemented by qualitative findings from participatory activities. The results of the study pinpoint the successful contribution of the cooperative to the improvement of farmers' working conditions and market access and suggest that supporting collective action among berry farmers can be an effective rural development intervention to alleviate rural poverty and prevent poverty fallouts. To date, structural characteristics of farm holdings and households and climate and market-related conditions have significantly contributed to the farmers' poverty as well as to farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 exposure to poverty. Furthermore, bridging the gender gap is still a challenge in Bosnia and Herzegovina which should be addressed urgently to mitigate the problem of social exclusion and to promote bottom-up innovation.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: FGT; Rural poverty; Mixed methods; Logistic regression; Cooperative; Gender\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dein Vindigni, Barbara Polus, Joan van Rotterdam, Cliff da Costa, Gay Edgecombe, Max Walsh, Michael Howard, Tuesday Bromwell, Alma Biasbas, Marc Cohen, Charlotte Patterson,\\r\\n',b'The Sustainable Training, Treatment, Employment Program Model: Effects of Manual Therapy on Musculoskeletal Pain and Limitation in a Filipino Squatter Community,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 34, Issue 6,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 381-387,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0161-4754,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2011.06.003.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016147541100131X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Objective\\r\\n',b'The purpose of this study is to describe the musculoskeletal conditions and associated pain and limitation and the effects of massage treatment in a Filipino squatter community.\\r\\n',b'Methods\\r\\n',b'The study was conducted at the Hands On Philippines Education (HOPE) clinic in Bagong Barrio, Caloocan, Philippines.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Elisa Consolandi,\\r\\n',b'Chapter 1.3 - Evolution and intensity of infection in Lombardy,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Emanuela Casti, Fulvio Adobati, Ilia Negri,\\r\\n',b'Modern Cartography Series,\\r\\n',b'Academic Press,\\r\\n',b'Volume 9,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'Pages 41-49,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1363-0814,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780323910613,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-91061-3.00008-9.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323910613000089)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: On a national scale, Lombardy is the region most intensely and severely affected by Covid-19.

This backbone may be said to have determined a regional bipartition, with a high intensity of contagion in less inhabited areas of Lombardy compared to metropolitan areas. As a matter of fact, the metropolitan area of Milan was initially spared and was severely hit only in the subsequent phase of contagion.

In 2008, the Mexican government launched a program where they matched funding from local partners to establish user-financed PWS, leading to the creation of 145 programs between 2008 and 2019. We study the factors related to the emergence and persistence of these local, user-financed PWS programs across Mexico. We assemble a unique database on these programs, as well as biophysical, economic, socio-cultural, and institutional variables, at the municipality level. We use logistic regression to analyze the variables correlated with the emergence and persistence of PWS. We find that PWS programs are more likely to emerge in municipalities with lower opportunity costs of forest conservation; that are wealthier; that have higher institutional capacity; and that have more collective land tenure and protected areas. PWS programs are more likely to persist in municipalities where watershed conditions are a concern; that have more wealth and institutional capacity; and that have a non-governmental organization or water utility involved as the local counterpart. These results suggest that emergence and persistence of local, user-financed PWS programs to address water security can occur when the opportunity costs of conservation are met; the provision of ecosystem services is enhanced; there are sustainable sources of financing; and there is institutional capacity that involves non-state actors.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Green infrastructure; Investments in watershed services; Nature-based solutions; Payments for ecosystem services; Pagos por servicios ambientales\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dieter Wang, Bo Pieter Johannes Andr\\xc3\\xa9e, Andres Fernando Chamorro, Phoebe Girouard Spencer,\\r\\n',b'Transitions into and out of food insecurity: A probabilistic approach with panel data evidence from 15 countries,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 159,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'106035,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2022.106035.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2200225X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Recent advances in food insecurity classification have made analytical approaches to predict and inform response to food crises possible. This paper develops a predictive, statistical framework to identify drivers of food insecurity risk with simulation capabilities for scenario analyses, risk assessment and forecasting purposes. It utilizes a panel vector-autoregression to model food insecurity distributions of 15 countries between October 2009 and February 2019. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods are employed to identify the most important agronomic, weather, conflict and economic variables. The paper finds that food insecurity dynamics are asymmetric and past-dependent, with low insecurity states more likely to transition to high insecurity states than vice versa. Conflict variables are more relevant for highly critical states, while agronomic and weather variables are more important for less critical states. Food prices are predictive for all cases. A Bayesian extension is introduced to incorporate expert opinions through the use of priors, which can lead to significant improvements in model performance.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food insecurity; Famine risk; Variable selection; Stochastic simulation; Panel vector-autoregression; Expert opinion\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shenggen Fan, Joanna Brzeska,\\r\\n',b'Chapter 66 Production, Productivity, and Public Investment in East Asian Agriculture,\\r\\n',b'Handbook of Agricultural Economics,\\r\\n',b'Elsevier,\\r\\n',b'Volume 4,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 3401-3434,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1574-0072,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780444518743,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0072(09)04066-3.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040663)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Since the 1950s, agricultural growth in East Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, and Taiwan) has reduced rural poverty and created a strong base for economic development. To gain a better understanding of the nature of this growth, we examine the sources of change in agricultural production and total factor productivity (TFP) and decompose the measurements into reform-based time periods. We also review studies that link public investments to agricultural growth and poverty reduction. We find that formulating growth-inducing and poverty-reducing strategies requires policymakers to understand the relative returns of different types of investments.

Our study tests the relationship between Jim Crow laws and social capital. Methods: We conducted 3-level multilevel hierarchical modeling to study differences in the stock of social capital for 1997, 2005, 2009 in Jim Crow states compared to states without Jim Crow laws. We examined the moderation effects of county level median income, percent Black and percent with high school education and Jim Crow laws on social capital. Results: Jim Crow laws significantly reduced stock of social capital across 1997, 2005, 2009. The model was robust to the inclusion of random county, states, time and fixed county and state level covariates for median income, percent Black and percent with high school education. The largest percent of between state variations explained for fixed variables was from the addition of Jim Crow laws with 2.86%. These results demonstrate that although Jim Crow laws were abolished in 1965, the effects of racial segregation appear to persist through lower social connectiveness, community and trust. A positive moderation effect was seen for median income and percent Black with Jim Crow laws on social capital. Discussion: Our study supports a negative association between Jim Crow laws and reduction in the stock of social capital. This may be attributed to the fracturing of trust, reciprocity and collective action produced by legal racial segregation. Findings from this study offer insight on the potential impacts of historical policies on the social structure of a community. Future research is necessary to further identify the mechanistic pathways and develop interventions to improve social capital.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Social capital; Jim Crow laws; Policy; Segregation; Social determinants of health; Health disparities; Health inequities\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Maggie Thorsen, Ronald McGarvey, Andreas Thorsen,\\r\\n',b'Diabetes management at community health centers: Examining associations with patient and regional characteristics, efficiency, and staffing patterns,\\r\\n',b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n',b'Volume 255,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'113017,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113017.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620302367)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: A major source of primary health care for millions of Americans, community health centers (CHCs) act as a key point of access for diabetes care. The ability of a CHC to deliver high quality care, that supports patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 management of their diabetes, may be impacted by the unique set of resources and constraints it faces, both in terms of characteristics of its patient population and aspects of operations. This study examines how patient and regional characteristics, staffing patterns, and efficiency were associated with diabetes management at CHCs (percentage of patients with uncontrolled diabetes, HbA1C\\xc2\\xa0>\\xc2\\xa09%). Data on a sample of 1229 CHCs came from multiple sources. CHC-level information was obtained from the Uniform Data System and regional-level information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the US Census American Community Survey. A clustering methodology, latent class analysis, identified seven underlying staffing patterns at CHCs. Data envelopment analysis was performed to evaluate the efficiency of CHCs, relative to centers with similar staffing patterns. Finally, generalized linear models were used to examine the association between staffing patterns, efficiency, and patient and regional-level characteristics. Findings from this study have sociological, practical, and methodological implications. Findings highlight that the intersection of patient racial composition with regional racial composition is significant; diabetes control appears to be worse at CHCs serving racial minorities living in predominantly White areas. Findings suggest that CHCs that incorporate more behavioral health care into their staffing mix have lower rates of uncontrolled diabetes among their patients. Finally, greater efficiency in CHC operations is associated with better diabetes control among patients. By identifying sociodemographic and operational characteristics associated with better hemoglobin control among diabetes patients, the current study contributes to our understanding of both health care operations and health inequalities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Diabetes; HbA1C; Community health centers; Staffing; Efficiency\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Lingyun Zhan, Shaojun Wang, Shenxiang Xie, Qingqing Zhang, Yanbo Qu,\\r\\n',b'Spatial path to achieve urban-rural integration development \\xe2\\x88\\x92 analytical framework for coupling the linkage and coordination of urban-rural system functions,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 142,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'102953,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102953.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397523002138)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This study presents a groundbreaking theoretical framework to examine the role of urban-rural system functions (URSFs) in the coordinated development of urban-rural integration (URI). The main emphasis is on the systematic, spatial, and procedural aspects of urban-rural relations (URRs), aiming to rectify the imbalances and deficiencies in URI development. Through multivariate measurement methods, the study evaluates the functional robustness of the urban-rural system (URS) from perspectives of living, production, and ecology, and distinguishes the degree of interaction and coordination. It introduces a spatial path for URI using module combinations and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint-axis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d abstract logic. An empirical analysis of China's eastern provinces discloses a noticeable decrease in URS functionality from developed to underdeveloped regions. Although linkage and complementarity between urban and rural areas are significant, mutual promotion and equilibrium between urban and rural production and living functions remain suboptimal. In Shandong Province, the coordination attributes of the three primary URSFs are predominantly characterized by low coordination, an imbalance type of weaker R, and significant urban overshadowing of rural dynamics. Urban-rural synchronous promotion overwhelmingly defines URS functional relationship typologies. The integrated pattern of urban-rural development (URD) after the integration of system functions is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoint-area\\xe2\\x80\\x9d feature, gradually expanding the scope from the URI model area, the URI pilot area, and the URI transition area to the URI key area, and shows the spatial structural layout of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo centers, three groups and six circles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. To achieve URI development, comprehensive planning and coordinated promotion of new urbanization and rural revitalization strategies are needed, focusing on micro-level rural regional system issues. The study emphasizes a new model and path for URI development, wherein urban areas support rural development, both develop synchronously, and rural development takes precedence over urban development.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban-rural integration development; Urban-rural system function; Linkage; Harmony; Spatial path; Shandong province\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Daniel L.

In an attempt to bring clarity to this conversation, our research presents an urban green gentrification framework, based on findings from a scoping review and dimensional analysis conducted across green gentrification, urban greening, and related literatures. Our study is guided by two primary objectives: (1) identify the key dimensions of green gentrification as it pertains to urban greening; and (2) explore the relationships and intersections between dimensions in terms of their implications for the social impacts and outcomes of urban greening initiatives. We identify three principle dimensions of green gentrification as it relates to urban greening \\xe2\\x80\\x94 conceptual foundations; design and intent; and socio-spatial change \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as well as six related sub-dimensions. Considered in tandem, these dimensions present green gentrification as a dynamic process bound within a history of exploitative, neoliberal social and economic processes, operating beyond the scope of any single urban greening initiative. Responding to green gentrification, therefore, requires trans-dimensional strategies that consider these structural influences guiding patterns of urban greening investment and development. Our results also show that green gentrification is not a sufficient explanation for the complexities of urban development and change, and greening should be considered alongside other drivers of gentrification more broadly.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Green gentrification; Urban greening; Nature-based solutions; Environmental justice\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Khalid Zaman, Muhammad Mushtaq Khan, Mehboob Ahmad,\\r\\n',b'RETRACTED: The relationship between foreign direct investment and pro-poor growth policies in Pakistan: The new interface,\\r\\n',b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n',b'Volume 29, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1220-1227,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.04.020.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312001137)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

From the perspective of anti-poverty, this paper examines the impact of formal credit constraints (FCCs) and informal credit constraints (IFCCs) on economic vulnerability (EV) using the data from the China Household Income Project (CHIP) survey for 2013 (CHIPs 2013) of rural households. The potential endogeneity problem of credit constraints (CCs) is addressed by applying the control function approach within an ordered probit model. The results show that both FCCs and IFCCs have a robust positive and significant impact on the EV of rural households and that the impact of FCCs is greater than that of IFCCs. To identify the potential mechanisms through which CCs affect EV, the seemingly unrelated regressions are used and the potential intercorrelation among these mechanisms is examined. We find that the impact of CCs on EV is partly mediated by health, trust, per capita financial assets and per capita income, whereby health and per capita income contribute to most of the total indirect effect. Thus, policies focus on supply-side and demand-side to improve credit accessibility could reduce rural households' EV, especially through its positive effect on health and per capita income.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: credit constraints; economic vulnerability; causal mediation mechanisms; rural China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Divyani Kohli, Alfred Stein, Richard Sliuzas,\\r\\n',b'Uncertainty analysis for image interpretations of urban slums,\\r\\n',b'Computers, Environment and Urban Systems,\\r\\n',b'Volume 60,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 37-49,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0198-9715,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.07.010.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198971516301533)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Image interpretations are used to identify slums in object-oriented image analysis (OOA). Such interpretations, however, contain uncertainties which may negatively impact the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we study the spatial uncertainties related to the delineations of slums as observed from very high resolution (VHR) images in the contexts of Ahmedabad (India), Nairobi (Kenya) and Cape Town (South Africa). Nineteen image interpretations and supplementary data were acquired for each context by means of semi-structured questionnaires. Slum areas agreed upon by different experts were determined. Uncertainty was modelled using random sets, and boundary variation was quantified using the bootstrapping method. Results show a highly significant difference between slum identification and delineation for the three contexts, whereas the level of experience in slum-related studies of experts is not significant. Factors of the built environment used by experts to distinguish slums from non-slum areas or leading to deviations in slum identification are discussed. We conclude that uncertainties in slum delineations from VHR images can be quantified successfully using modern spatial statistical methods.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Existential uncertainty; Extensional uncertainty; Informal settlements; Remote sensing; Random sets; Object-oriented image analysis (OOA)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David Cuberes, Jennifer Roberts, Cristina Sechel,\\r\\n',b'Household location in English cities,\\r\\n',b'Regional Science and Urban Economics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 75,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 120-135,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0166-0462,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2019.01.012.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166046218301054)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper is the first to test an amenity-based sorting model for cities in England. We explore household location under both monocentric and polycentric assumptions about city structure. On average, we find no systematic relationship between income and household distance to the city centre. However, there are differences between cities, with a positive income-distance relationship in Birmingham and Leeds, and a negative relationship in Newcastle. Household heterogeneity is also important; for example, on average households with heads who are migrants live 25% closer to the centre than non-migrants. We also find that only the employed (and those above the poverty line) are influenced by the availability of public transport, which is in direct opposition to the US evidence.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Cities; Household location; Income; Amenities\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kristof De Witte, Sofie Cabus, Geert Thyssen, Wim Groot, Henri\\xc3\\xabtte Maassen van den Brink,\\r\\n',b'A critical review of the literature on school dropout,\\r\\n',b'Educational Research Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 10,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 13-28,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1747-938X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.edurev.2013.05.002.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X13000286)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper reviews the growing literature on early school leaving.

Applying a multilevel model on a large dataset of about 90,000 households, we find that the share of households at risk of becoming food-insecure (vulnerability) is higher than the share that is current food-insecure. Households in rural areas are least vulnerable. In contrast, residents of cities and urban areas experience high level of vulnerability that exceeds the average in the Punjab. The risk-induced vulnerability is higher than the structural-induced vulnerability and vulnerability to idiosyncratic shock is higher than vulnerability to covariate shocks. Findings imply that households in the Punjab are vulnerable not as a result of poor resource endowments but because of risk. The Pakistani government should go beyond mere observed food-insecurity to address the needs of the relatively larger population that is at risk of being food-insecure in the future.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food-insecurity; Vulnerability; Shocks; Multilevel model; Punjab; Pakistan\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mazifah Simis, Azahan Awang, Kadir Arifin,\\r\\n',b\"From Ex-landfill to Public Park: Impact on Local Community's Quality of Life and Living Environment,\\r\\n\",b'Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 222,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 763-771,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1877-0428,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.05.157.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042816302312)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Regarded as a new development urban planning approach in developing countries, brownfield regeneration, particularly the redevelopment of ex-landfills as public parks in Malaysia, leads to the question of this research: could such development benefit the local communities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quality of life and living environment?

Against this background, we investigate the role of higher education for urban growth in China. A panel data analysis reveals that an increase of share in the population with at least a bachelor's degree induces regional population to grow. Nevertheless, contrary to other developed countries, inflow of high caliber immigrants from the countryside or cities of lower tiers in China in fact brings down real wages. We hypothesize that in China where education resources are limited, higher education attainment induces faster urban growth through breaking the barriers to rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban transition for new job market entrants, but at the cost of lower real wages due to affluent labor supply. However, the increase of population share with high education has insignificant direct impact on housing price, indicating that new talented migrants may not be the major home buyers. Yet, through the trigger of a faster urbanization process, housing prices are jetted up indirectly in provinces with higher proportions of degree holders. It poses pressing challenges to China where the country is advocating the idea of inclusive urbanization. This paper will discuss some of the key issues in relation to the provisions of education and housing services in China such that local governments can be more embracing to rural degree holder migrants, who will play a contributing role in urban growth.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Higher education; Employment; Housing price; Real wage; Urban growth\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rita Schneider-Sliwa,\\r\\n',b'Urban Geography,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

Over the past decade, societies have witnessed changes that were unprecedented in recent history: the collapse of political and economic systems, new integration policies, globalization of the economy and the decline of the nation-state, mass migration, governmental retrenchment, and social restructuring. Structural changes in societies manifest themselves distinctly in urban areas and every generation needs to engage in the discourse on a country's built politics, the sustainability of urban form and design, and the ecological footprint of major cities and suburban areas. Urban geography deals with the analysis of the complex dimensions of urban social, economic, cultural, and political processes, patterns, and structures and urban planning processes to build up or retain local comparative advantages, while retaining cities as livable urban places and securing their sound social and environmental development for future generations. This article describes the conceptual and methodological approaches and the long-term prospects of urban geography.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban development; Urban geography; Urban research; Urban social geography; Urban studies\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Nik Ahmad Sufian Burhan, Yohan Kurniawan, Abdul Halim Sidek, Mohd Rosli Mohamad,\\r\\n',b'Crimes and the Bell curve: The role of people with high, average, and low intelligence,\\r\\n',b'Intelligence,\\r\\n',b'Volume 47,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 12-22,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0160-2896,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2014.08.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289614001238)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The present study examines whether crime rates can be reduced by increasing the IQ of people with high, average, and low IQ. Previous studies have shown that as a determinant of the national level of income per capita growth and technological achievement, the IQ of the intellectual class (those at the 95th percentile of the Bell curve distribution of population intelligence) is more important than the IQ of those with average ability at the 50th percentile. Extending these findings, our study incorporates the non-intellectual class (IQ at the 5th percentile) to examine the role of IQ classes in determining crime rates across countries. We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses with IQ, seven types of crimes, and nine control variables: urbanization, alcohol consumption, unemployment rate, young to old population ratio, income inequality, education attainment, drug consumption, police rate, and income per capita. Regardless of types of crimes, we found evidence that raising IQ will lessen crime rates, with raises in the 95th percentile group having the most number of significant impacts, followed by the 50th and then the 5th percentile groups. Furthermore, none of the nine control factors was stronger than the 95th percentile group in predicting crime rates. We conclude that the intellectual class influences rates of more types of crime than the non-intellectual class does. The intellectual class has the highest authority in determining law enforcement and development policies. Therefore, increasing the IQ of politicians and leaders from this class than other social classes will have a more significant influence in reducing crime rates, through enhanced functionality and quality of institutions across countries.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Bell curve; Crimes; Intellectual class; National IQ; Non-intellectual class\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n',b'8 - The consequences of the obesity epidemic on food production: empirical evidence from Latin American and Caribbean countries,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Matheus Koengkan, Jos\\xc3\\xa9 Alberto Fuinhas, Aida Isabel Pereira Tavares, Nuno Miguel Barateiro Gon\\xc3\\xa7alves Silva,\\r\\n',b'Obesity Epidemic and the Environment,\\r\\n',b'Academic Press,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'Pages 219-240,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780323993395,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-99339-5.00010-8.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323993395000108)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This chapter investigates the impact of the obesity epidemic on food production. Obesity is a public health problem, and a range of different factors cause it. On the other hand, the high prevalence of obesity creates economic effects. Therefore, this chapter approached the topic of whether the obesity problem contributes to an increase in food production. The data from 16 LAC countries from 1991 to 2016 and the ordinary least squares (OLS) model approach were used to carry out this investigation. The main result of this estimation confirms the positive correlation between food production and obesity. This result is supported by the social and economic processes of urbanisation and globalisation brought by economic growth, which increases production, including food production, and increases the prevalence of obesity.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food production; Income; Latin America and the Caribbean; Obesity; OLS model; Poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Santha Vaithilingam, Mahendhiran Nair, Mary Macharia, Viswanath Venkatesh,\\r\\n',b'Mobile communication and use behavior of the urban poor in a developing country: A field study in Malaysia,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Information Management,\\r\\n',b'Volume 63,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'102440,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0268-4012,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2021.102440.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026840122100133X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: We developed a contextualized model to predict the use of technology among the urban poor.

Such assessments may be imprecise as they do not reflect the impact of people's daily mobility patterns. Furthermore, most studies have focused on urban areas in developed countries, whilst relatively little is known about the situation in developing nations, particularly a tropical climate region where heat exposure is severe for residents. As a case study in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we conducted a heat exposure assessment by integrating individual mobility data which was obtained from a questionnaire survey. Estimates of heat exposure were made using remotely sensed land surface temperature data. Population exposures based on residential locations were compared to a dynamic exposure model that incorporated mobility. Especially for people in suburban areas, we found the traditional assessment method based on the static residential model underestimated exposure compared to the dynamic model owing to the fact that some residents migrate into the city center each day where they tend to experience higher temperatures. We found small differences in heat exposure levels between social groups stratified by gender, age, and income based on the dynamic and static models. These results demonstrate that integration of mobility patterns may be important when comparing exposure levels between urban and suburban populations. Our findings may raise issues regarding new remediation measures against urban heat islands, such as reviewing the distribution of health resources or generating a risk map.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Population mobility; Heat exposure assessment; Geographic information systems; Remote sensing; Bangladesh\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Uttam Paudel, Krishna Prasad Pant,\\r\\n',b'Understanding vitality of public space: A review with an example of capital city Kathmandu in Nepal,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 133,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'106860,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2023.106860.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837723003265)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: By definition, public spaces are areas or locations that are open and accessible to all people, and in cities they are open space that is specifically concerned with public health, social cohesion, and the quality of urban life. This paper reports a review of literatures on urban public spaces attempting to gauge the research gaps on public spaces through a scoping-review analysis of relevant studies. The review of relevant literatures published from 1990 to 2023 led to an inference that there is a huge gap in defining the publicness (non-excludable and non-rival) of the public spaces in Nepal. Furthermore, knowledge about public spaces is found to be scattered. However, all Nepal-based research identified that open spaces in Kathmandu valley were severely encroached upon. Rapid urbanization, along with a lack of resilient urban planning and governance, appears to have a significant influence on urban public spaces and social cohesion, as well as diseconomies in emerging economies. Social inequalities, health disparities, environmental injustice, economic instability and stifled cultural expression are all intricately bound to urban public spaces, particularly green public space, which still remains a research priority for new evidence-based urban policymakers and urban planners in developing countries. Future research should therefore focus on a multilevel approach preferably using network model to cover and comprehend the societal-benefits of public space, extending large-scale quantitative assessments with field evaluations of each public space, community surveys, and other qualitative research in Nepal. Component-wise research gaps are also evidently explored in the course of separate domains.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban public space; Green space; Social cohesion; Healthy lifestyle; Economic stability\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Daina Romeo, Eldbj\\xc3\\xb8rg Blikra Vea, Marianne Thomsen,\\r\\n',b'Environmental Impacts of Urban Hydroponics in Europe: A Case Study in Lyon,\\r\\n',b'Procedia CIRP,\\r\\n',b'Volume 69,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 540-545,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2212-8271,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2017.11.048.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221282711730820X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The food provisioning of European cities depends on the global food supply system. However, both economic crises, environmental pressure and climate change effects represent a risk for food chain stability. Urban agriculture (UA) increases the self-sufficiency and resiliency of cities and is able to deliver positive environmental and social benefits. However, its efficacy depends on several variables, including the type of UA and the geographical location of the city. This paper analyses ReFarmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pilot farm, a vertical high-yield hydroponic croft located in the urban area of Lyon, France, from a life cycle perspective. The results show that the hydroponic farm performs better than cultivations in heated greenhouses, and similarly to conventional open field farms. Moreover, the source of the electricity input is a determinant factor that, if carbon neutral (e.g. wind energy) allows vertical hydroponic production to outperform the two conventional types of agriculture.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Life Cycle Assessment; Urban agriculture; Hydroponics\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Maria Sagrario Floro, Ranjula Bali Swain,\\r\\n',b'Food Security, Gender, and Occupational Choice among Urban Low-Income Households,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 42,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 89-99,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.08.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12002185)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'This paper examines an adaptive strategy using occupational choice that can be undertaken by household members in urban poor areas to help ensure their access to food.

As urbanization continues, this presents serious problems for biodiversity and the realization of Sustainable Development Goal 7. Understanding the persistent demand for charcoal, especially among urban households with access to electricity, is a critical step towards ensuring sustainable forest management while encouraging households to transition to cleaner sources of energy. Herein, we profile urban charcoal users living in the heart of southern Africa's miombo woodlands. We use an ordinary least squares regression model to predict charcoal consumption among a sample of households in Tete, Mozambique with widespread connectivity to the electrical grid. Our findings indicate that income plays only a negligible role in predicting monthly per capita charcoal consumption. More important are personal preferences and the peer effects of friendships with non-charcoal using peers. These findings present possible pathways for policy-makers to induce a shift in charcoal demand among urban households and to promote switching to cleaner cooking fuels.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Charcoal; Peer effects; Multiple fuels model; Clean energy; SDG-7; Mozambique\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Asma Mohsin, Khalid Zaman,\\r\\n',b'RETRACTED: Distributional effects of rising food prices in Pakistan: Evidence from HIES 2001\\xe2\\x80\\x9302 and 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9306 survey,\\r\\n',b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n',b'Volume 29, Issue 5,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1986-1995,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.06.002.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312001757)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

It first provides a historical account of the relations between mining activities and emergence of towns. Second, the legal environment informing the development or otherwise of mining towns is presented. Third, implications of mining induced towns on Ghana's urban planning are discussed. Using documentary review and empirical cases of selected mining towns, findings indicate that the political economic situation of Ghana's mining industry has produced and continues to shape affected intermediate towns in five ways: 1) some mining towns are experiencing relative growth, while others are slowly dying; 2) death or complete collapse of mining communities after mining boom 3) changed functions and local economy after mine operations are closed down; 4) emergence of new mining settlements resulting from new investments; and 5) resettlement communities resulting from displacement from the harmful effects of mine operations. These factors have implications for urban planning, and this paper proposes three entry points with implications for other developing countries: a space in Ghana's urban development policy for mining towns; a re-look at the content and focus of corporate social responsibilities of mining firms; and a functional link between growth of mining and urban planning.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Human settlements; Urban planning; Mining towns; Political economy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kirti Gaur, Kunal Keshri, William Joe,\\r\\n',b\"Does living in slums or non-slums influence women's nutritional status?

The analysis is based on the National Family Health Survey (2005\\xe2\\x80\\x9306) of India and highlights the dual burden of malnutrition among urban women. The results show that one in every two women in mega-cities is malnourished (either undernourished or overnourished), but a biased, analytical focus on citywide averages conceals the nature of the problem. Overnutrition among women is notably higher in non-slum areas whereas underweight persists as a key concern among slum dwellers. Cities located in the Central India (Nagpur and Indore) have the highest proportion of underweight women whereas the cities in South India (Chennai and Hyderabad) show a high prevalence of overweight women across both slum and non-slum areas. The intensity of income-related inequalities in underweight outcome is much greater for non-slum areas, whereas inequalities in overweight outcomes are higher among slums. Furthermore, regression analysis indicates that place of residence as such has no significant impact on women's nutritional status and that this elementary association is primarily a ramification mediated through other key socioeconomic correlates. Results suggest that, it would be rational to develop a comprehensive urban nutritional plan that focuses on dietary planning and behaviour change to address both type of malnutrition at the same time.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: India; Undernutrition; Overnutrition; Malnutrition duality; Income-inequality; Women; Slum and non-slum\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gary S.

These challenges generally faced by less developing countries, while Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries has no exemption to escape out from this food-water-energy poverty nexus due to inadequate socio-economic and environmental action programs of sustainable development. This study examined the dynamic nexus between agricultural sustainability and food-energy-water poverty in a panel of selected SSA countries over the period of 1980\\xe2\\x80\\x932013. The study used pooled least squares regression, pooled fixed effects, and pooled random effects regression techniques to absorb country-specific-time-variant shocks. The Hausman (1978) test results reveal that country-specific shocks influence the food-energy-water poverty model; therefore, the fixed effects regression results are consider a better fit model than that of the pooled random effect model. The overall results conclude that agricultural value added, cereal yields and forest area significantly decreases food-energy-water poverty nexus, leading to higher economic growth and price levels at the cost of environmental degradation. In general, agricultural sustainability is the prerequisite for reducing food-energy-water poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Agricultural sustainability; Food poverty; Energy poverty; Water poverty; Sub-Saharan African countries\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ramit Debnath, Ronita Bardhan, Minna Sunikka-Blank,\\r\\n',b'Discomfort and distress in slum rehabilitation: Investigating a rebound phenomenon using a backcasting approach,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 87,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 75-90,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2019.03.010.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397519300839)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Slum rehabilitation policies in India is observed to have a rebound effect on the occupants, where rehabilitated occupants move back to the horizontal slums. In this study, we investigate the cause behind this rebound phenomenon based on a theory of homeostasis, where the loss of homeostasis refers to occupants' heightened discomfort and distress in their built environment. A novel methodological framework was developed to investigate it based on the principles of participatory backcasting approach and the theory of homeostasis. Thirty households in Mumbai's slum rehabilitation housing were interviewed to determine the social, economic and environmental cause of distress and discomfort. Granular information was obtained by further investigating the factors that influence occupants' attitude, emotions, health, control and habits in their built environment that regulates their holistic comfort and lack of stress. The causal linkages among these factors were established using a qualitative fault tree. Results show two primary cause of distress and discomfort in the study area owing to economic distress and built environment related discomfort. Economic distress was from low-income and high electricity bills due to higher household appliance ownership, and built environment discomfort was due to lack of social spaces and poor design of the slum rehabilitation housing. This study showed that mitigating such non-income drivers of distress and discomfort can prevent rebound phenomenon and improve the sustainability of the slum rehabilitation process.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Slum rehabilitation; Sustainability; Homeostasis; Discomfort; Distress; Urban; Poverty; Energy; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Andrew P.

However, progressive land abandonment in these areas questions the rationale and targeting of support payments to maintain viable farming enterprises. Using micro level data on farm businesses over the period 2003-2016 matched to land capability and spatial data we identify the distribution of viable and vulnerable enterprises in Less Favoured Areas. We find five categories of household based on progressive quality of life thresholds, namely i. vulnerable, ii. sustainable, iii. viable, iv. resilient, and v. robust. A proportional odds model measured the effect of biophysical and remote disadvantage on predicting these states of viability, along with farm family lifecycle factors. Whilst we would expect higher proportions of disadvantaged farmland to be negatively related to viability, when combined with rural remoteness this increases the magnitude of the effect. However, clear succession planning and tenancy arrangements suggest that approaches to management of the business and the farm family life-cycle may overcome some of these disadvantages. These results have to be considered against the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s planned withdrawal from the Common Agricultural Policy. This offers opportunities to provide a more nuanced approach to targeting and supporting disadvantaged regions beyond current criteria. However, there would seem to be dissonance between the proposed payment for public goods agenda, which is results orientated, and support for correcting natural disadvantages where opportunities for delivery of these public goods will be limited.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Less favoured areas; Proportional odds model; Payment for public goods; Brexit\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Susan Parnell,\\r\\n',b'Defining a Global Urban Development Agenda,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 78,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 529-540,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2015.10.028.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X15002508)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'The United Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent endorsement of a stand-alone urban Sustainable Development Goal and the immanent formulation of Habitat III marks a watershed in global development discourse on cities. The New Urban Agenda, currently under debate, is located in its historical context to reveal who the major actors and institutions were that defined global urban policy; what the shifting normative positions on cities are; and why the increasingly complex process of the global policy environment makes defining a universal agreement on urban development so hard. At stake in UN negotiations are fundamental issues about the centrality of urban pathways to sustainable development. A historical view of the Habitat process reveals that even at the global scale it is possible for those with strong convictions to change the normative base and mode of working on urban issues, but that the compromise politics of the international system also masks important compromises and contradictions. Looking back over the decades of international debate on development priorities shows not only that there is now greater acceptance of the importance of defining and agreeing to \\xe2\\x80\\x9can urban agenda\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but that global policy on urban and regional issues has indeed evolved.

Our main measure of welfare is spatially adjusted per capita consumption expenditure. Using the unconditional quantile regression decomposition, we find that the majority of the observed gap in each year is explained by the urban advantage in endowments. Difference in educational distributions across urban and rural areas explains a significant part of the gap observed in each year. Over time, there has been a gradual widening of the urban-rural gap. A decomposition of the change in the gap over 1983\\xe2\\x80\\x932011 suggests that increasing gap between urban and rural areas in the share of tertiary educated population accounts for a significant part of the observed increase in the gap.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban-rural welfare gap; Unconditional quantile regression; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Chen Yang, Zhu Qian, Huan Li,\\r\\n',b'Measuring the accessibility deprivation of concentrated resettlement communities in China: An integrated approach of space syntax and multi-criteria decision analysis,\\r\\n',b'Applied Geography,\\r\\n',b'Volume 150,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'102839,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0143-6228,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102839.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622822002107)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: China's rapid urbanization involves the large-scale relocation of rural villagers and the production of concentrated resettlement communities in urban areas. This new urban population's post-resettlement adaptation and socio-economic situations raise concerns for urban scholars and policymakers alike. This paper invokes the concept of deprivation and aims to establish indices of multiple deprivations (IMDs) for such communities. In doing so, this research use accessibility as a proxy and integrates the space syntax approach with multi-criteria decision analysis to construct the IMDs of concentrated resettlement communities in Hangzhou, China. The findings suggest that material deprivation may not be the primary concern for residential segregation of resettlement communities in urban areas. Besides, the accessibility to different services reflects diverse deprivation patterns among resettlement communities. Moreover, various stakeholder groups' perceptions of deprivation may lead to different results of the IMDs. The diverse criteria or domains of deprivation contribute differently to the deprivation, which requires a tailored treatment strategy when constructing IMDs, such as the sensitivity analysis used in this research. The proposed measurement of deprivation has important policy implications for sustainable urban development in China.\\r\\n\",b'\\n',b'Hernan Galperin, Raul Katz, Ramiro Valencia,\\r\\n',b'The impact of broadband on poverty reduction in rural Ecuador,\\r\\n',b'Telematics and Informatics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 75,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'101905,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0736-5853,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2022.101905.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0736585322001381)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This study examines the impact of broadband deployment on labor income and employment (in both level and composition) in rural Ecuador. The analysis spans the 2011 to 2019 period, during which the share of rural households covered by high-speed broadband increased from 14.5% to 83%. The empirical strategy exploits variations in the timing of network deployment, as well as the fact that several rural areas remained unserved by 2019. To estimate impact, the study uses a semi-parametric alternative to the standard two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) estimator proposed by Callaway and Sant\\xe2\\x80\\x99Anna (2021). Overall, the findings indicate that broadband deployment in rural areas is associated with measurable gains in labor income and employment. Our income model estimates range from an increase of 14% to 21% above the expected level had broadband not been deployed in these areas. The impact estimates on employment are more modest, ranging from 3% to 5% (depending on the specification) above the mean employment level over the study period. Additionally, our results corroborate that ICTs help diversify employment opportunities, as the share of agricultural employment falls in the connected areas. The findings also suggest that the economic benefits associated with broadband favor younger workers, presumably because their skills better match the newly created jobs.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Broadband Impact; Rural Development; Latin America; Difference-in-Difference\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xia Wang, Shaoqi Hai, Peiru Cai,\\r\\n',b'Urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural disparity of child poverty in China: Spatio-temporal changes and influencing factors,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Rural Studies,\\r\\n',b'Volume 91,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'Pages 170-183,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0743-0167,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.03.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016722000444)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Abstract\\r\\n',b'Eradicating child poverty and shrinking urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural disparity are the common goals of humanity.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the likely increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions from rising incomes among the world's poor. We examine drivers of and predict appliance ownership using machine learning and other techniques with household survey data in India, South Africa and Brazil. Televisions and refrigerators are consistently preferred over washing machines. Income is still the predominant driver of aggregate penetration levels, but its influence differs by appliance and by region. The affordability of appliances, wealth, race and religion together, among other household characteristics, help explain the heterogeneity in appliance ownership at lower income levels. Understanding non-income drivers can be helpful to identify barriers to appliance uptake and to better forecast near term residential energy demand growth within countries.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Household behavior; Residential energy; Appliance diffusion\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Nijika Shrivastwa, Brenda W.

Using original survey data from rural India, we show that seasonal migrants prefer to earn 35 percent less on local public works rather than incur the cost of migrating. Structural estimates suggest that the fixed cost of migration is small, and can be entirely explained by travel costs and income risk. In contrast, the flow cost of migration is high. We argue that higher living costs in the city explain only a small part of the flow cost of migration and that most of it is non-monetary.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Internal migration; Workfare programs; India; Urban; Rural\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Raheela Saad,\\r\\n',b'Women and DRR in urban slums \\xe2\\x80\\x93 building resilience through development,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n',b'Volume 60,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'102264,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102264.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420921002302)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Rapid, unplanned growth of urban areas in South Asia and an increase in absolute poverty have led to the phenomenon of \\xe2\\x80\\x9curbanisation of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, resulting in a massive increase in slums across all major cities in countries like Pakistan. This has compounded the vulnerability and exposure ofresidents in these slums to disasters, especially as an outcome of exposure to hazards. Amongst the most vulnerable are women, typically lying near the bottom of not just the poverty or wealth index, but in nearly every index of human development, giving rise to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeminisation of poverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. An increased frequency of disasters, coupled with multidimensional vulnerabilities, high probability of exposure and compromised capacities places the women highest in the risk profile for disasters also. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) has shifted focus from disaster management to disaster risk management (DRM) by setting goals for both, preventing new and reducing existing disaster risks, by strengthening community resilience through socio-economic and other development measures. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) aim to leave no one behind in enhancing capacities of individuals and communities through development. In this context, understanding the vulnerabilities and associated risks for women, especially those who are in urban slums which have so far been treated by policy makers as an amorphous mass within the greater urban world, becomes critical. Gender vulnerability in a disaster-risk context directly links to pre-existing vulnerabilities within the society as being outcomes of skewed development processes, poverty, construed status of women and rapid urbanisation. In order to empower these women effectively, it is critical to understand the pre-existing vulnerabilities, or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvulnerability bundles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and address them by focusing on reducing the risks they generate with reference to the four priority areas of the SFDRR. An analysis using five dimensions of vulnerability that has been recognised through research over the years, substantiates that women in urban slums are more susceptible to being affected by disasters as an outcome of the daily challenges that they face. Some of these challenges include patriarchal society, sociocultural and religious beliefs, gender stereotyping, insecure livelihoods, non-availability of services such as WASH, health and education, sexual abuse and violence, and a lack of legal identity. Disaster risk reduction measures for women living in slums should aim to minimise risks for them, while enhancing their resilience by reducing vulnerabilities and increasing capacities, by working through the socioeconomic systems within their circumstances. Therefore, emphasis has to be on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cun-skewing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d development by making it risk-based, inclusive and comprehensive towards reducing vulnerabilities of the women in urban slums. There should also be efforts towards enhancing their coping capacities, which, like vulnerability, needs management through the development portfolio. Increasing resilience can be incremental through radical policies and targeted development through the portfolio of SDGs, leading to greater investment in slums through public works.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban slums; Gender vulnerability; SFDRR; SDGs DRM\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Melody Esther Tulier, Carolina Reid, Mahasin S.

Increased attention on urban health inequities have propelled research on the relationship between gentrification and health. Yet, there are significant challenges inherent in the study of gentrification given its non-linear process occurring at multiple levels and via various mechanisms in a complex web of urban systems. How then have empirical studies addressed questions regarding the relationship between gentrification and health and wellness from a conceptual and methodological standpoint? Applying key search terms to PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 546 papers published in the United States. This review is guided by three foundational premises informing the inclusion and exclusion of articles. These include: 1. a clear definition of gentrification and explicit health outcome; 2. identification of a specific geographic context (United States) in which gentrification occurs, and 3. use of a social determinants of health framework to identify potential health outcomes of interest. 17 papers met our inclusion criteria. Through systematic content analysis using MaxQDA software, we evaluated the included studies using three critical frames: 1. conceptualization of gentrification; 2. mechanisms linking gentrification and health; and 3. spatio-temporal considerations. Based on this analysis, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing research, and offer three methodological approaches to strengthen the current literature on gentrification and health. We recommend that future studies: 1. explicitly identify the mechanisms and levels at which processes can occur and systems are organized; 2. incorporate space and time into the analytical strategy and 3. articulate an epistemological standpoint driven by their conceptualization of the exposure and identification of the relevant mechanism and outcome of interest.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shariska Petersen, Parmida Shahiri, Andrea Jewell, Lori Spoozak, Julia Chapman, Sharon Fitzgerald-Wolff, Sue Min Lai, Dineo Khabele,\\r\\n',b'Disparities in ovarian cancer survival at the only NCI-designated cancer center in Kansas,\\r\\n',b'The American Journal of Surgery,\\r\\n',b'Volume 221, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'Pages 712-717,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0002-9610,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjsurg.2020.12.009.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000296102030787X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Background\\r\\n',b'This study examined the impact of geographic distance on survival outcomes for patients receiving treatment for ovarian cancer at the only NCI-designated cancer center (NCI-CC) in Kansas.\\r\\n',b'Methods\\r\\n',b'We identified ovarian cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Cancer Center between 2010 and 2015.

Given that many SDGs are closely related to the environment in which people live, satellite data are commonly used for SDG assessment, but they are only based on a top-down view and have inherent technical issues (e.g., insufficient spatial resolution and cloud coverage). In recent years, street view imagery (SVI), as an emerging source of remote sensing data, has been an indispensable supplement to monitor SDGs, by recording the environment from an eye-level view. However, the systematic and comprehensive understanding of SVI applications to promote SDGs is insufficient. We reviewed SVI-related studies of SDGs and found that SVI is mainly used for good health and well-being (SDG 3), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), zero hunger (SDG 2), and climate action (SDG 13). The SVI-based greenery view index was the most common element feature related to SDGs. The SVI-derived human perception features were also often used to assess SDG 3 and SDG 11. Future studies may further investigate the potential mechanisms between SVI-based features and SDGs. This review provides a comprehensive summary and guidance for governments and scholars worldwide to assess SDGs based on SVI in the future.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Sustainable Development Goal; Street view image; Environment monitoring; Greenness; Systematic review; Green space; Health geography; Spatial epidemiology\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Umut Do\\xc4\\x9fan, Merve Ko\\xc3\\xa7ak G\\xc3\\xbcng\\xc3\\xb6r, B\\xc3\\xbclent Bostanc\\xc4\\xb1, Ne\\xc5\\x9fe Y\\xc4\\xb1lmaz Bak\\xc4\\xb1r,\\r\\n',b'GIS Based Urban Renewal Area Awareness and Expectation Analysis Using Fuzzy Modeling,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 54,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'101945,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.101945.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670719309552)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: It is necessary to establish a new urban renewal approach, prioritizing the participation of the local society with the capability to resolve problems with the contributions of government, private sectors, and society.

Because of the lack of modelling regarding the spatial references in these questionnaire-based studies, no significant contributions can be made in the decision-making processes of planning that drive sustainable urban transformation.

There have been numerous studies explaining how economic growth can affect various dimensions of human development. Further, additional arguments have been generated to indicate that tourism may also be the vehicle with which to impact human development and economic growth. However, the literature on the nexus between human development, economic growth, and tourism is riddled with mixed results. The results from this study suggest the presence of three unique long-run relationships. First, tourism does not promote human development. Instead, it is the degree and measure of human development that promotes tourism by creating a lopsided relationship. Second, a virtuous cycle between human development and economic growth exists. Third, the study found a unidirectional causality supporting the economics-driven tourism growth, meaning that tourism growth is a product of economic growth but not vice versa. The study concludes with implications for tourism development in the case of Ecuador.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Quality of life; Co-integration; Error correction; Granger causality; Tourism arrivals; Human development; Economic growth; Ecuador\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sanatan Nayak, Surendra Singh Jatav,\\r\\n',b'Are livelihoods of slum dwellers sustainable and secure in developing economies?

Urban informal settlements, usually defined by certain criteria such as self-build housing, sub-standard services, and residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 low incomes, are often seen as problematic, due to associations with poverty, irregularity and marginalisation. In particular, despite years of research and policy, gaps in urban theory and limited understandings of urban informal settlements mean that they are often treated as outside \\xe2\\x80\\x98normal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 urban considerations, with material effects for residents including discrimination, eviction and displacement. In response to these considerations, this article uses a place-making approach to explore the spatial, social and cultural construction of place in this context, in order to unsettle some of the assumptions underlying discursive constructions of informal settlements, and how these relate to spatial and social marginalisation. Research was carried out using a qualitative, ethnographic methodology in two case study neighbourhoods in Xalapa, Mexico. Mexico offers fertile ground to explore these issues. Despite an extensive land tenure regularisation programme, at least 60 per cent of urban dwellers live in colonias populares, neighbourhoods with informal characteristics. The research found that local discourses reveal complex and ambivalent views of colonias populares, which both reproduce and undermine marginalising tendencies relating to \\xe2\\x80\\x98informality\\xe2\\x80\\x99. A focus on residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own place-making activities hints at prospects for rethinking urban informal settlements. By capturing the messy, dynamic and contextualised processes that construct urban informal settlements as places, the analytical lens of place-making offers a view of the multiple influences which frame them. Informed by perspectives from critical social geography which seek to capture the \\xe2\\x80\\x98ordinary\\xe2\\x80\\x99 nature of cities, this article suggests imagining urban informal settlements differently, in order to re-evaluate their potential contribution to the city as a whole.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban informal settlements; Place-making; Marginalisation; Place identity; Mexico\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ntobeko Mchunu, Gareth Lagerwall, Aidan Senzanje,\\r\\n',b'Aquaponics in South Africa: Results of a national survey,\\r\\n',b'Aquaculture Reports,\\r\\n',b'Volume 12,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 12-19,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2352-5134,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2018.08.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352513418300383)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Aquaponic system is a productive, innovative and sustainable fish and vegetable production system that could contribute to the needed innovation in agriculture in the face of drought, soil pollution and climate change. Aquaponics are still an emerging practice worldwide, but particularly in South Africa. This study was conducted in 2016 using an online survey questionnaire to collect information about the types of systems used, the management and distribution of aquaponics in South Africa. A total of 44 responses were captured within three months. The most commonly raised fish was tilapia (82%). The most commonly raised plants were leafy vegetables (75%). Since aquaponics is still not practiced by many and aquaponics systems are mostly small, aquaponics in South Africa can be considered an emerging practice. Most of the current aquaponics practitioners have limited aquaponics production knowledge. We therefore conclude that attention should be paid to raising the awareness about the potential of aquaponics, and raising the technological knowledge of aquaponics operators to increase the number of aquaponics operations and to increase the total amount of food produced in and with aquaponics.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Aquaponics; Leafy vegetables; Tilapia; Small systems\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Zhilin Zeng, Juan Zhan, Liyuan Chen, Huilong Chen, Sheng Cheng,\\r\\n',b'Global, regional, and national dengue burden from 1990 to 2017: A systematic analysis based on the global burden of disease study 2017,\\r\\n',b'EClinicalMedicine,\\r\\n',b'Volume 32,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'100712,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2589-5370,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100712.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020304569)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Background\\r\\n',b'Dengue is one of the most common vector-borne diseases globally, however, its burden is poorly quantified.

All estimates were reported as numbers and rates per 100 000 population, with 95% uncertainty intervals.\\r\\n',b'Findings\\r\\n',b'Globally, the total number of dengue cases increased from 23 283 274 (95% UI 453 180.7\\xe2\\x80\\x9351 840 670) in 1990 to 104 771 911 (95% UI 63 759 019\\xe2\\x80\\x93158 870 031) in 2017. The age-standardised incidence rate increased from 431.6 (8.4\\xe2\\x80\\x93961.0) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 1371.3 (834.5\\xe2\\x80\\x932079.3) per 100 000 population in 2017. In addition, the number of deaths due to dengue increased from approximately16 957 (7 613\\xe2\\x80\\x9330 091) in 1990 to 40 467 (17 620\\xe2\\x80\\x9349 778) in 2017. Meanwhile, the global age-standardised death rate increased from 0.31 (0.14\\xe2\\x80\\x930\\xe2\\x80\\xa256) per 100 000 population in 1990 to 0.53 (0.23\\xe2\\x80\\x930\\xe2\\x80\\xa265) per 100 000 population in 2017. Overall, there were 2 922 630 DALYs (1 629 424\\xe2\\x80\\x933 967 492) attributed to dengue in 2017 globally, an increase of 107.6% since 1990 (1 407 571 DALYs [624 016.4\\xe2\\x80\\x932 510 025]), and the age-standardised DALY rate increased from 26.10 (11.57\\xe2\\x80\\x9346.53) per 100 000 population to 38.25 (21.33\\xe2\\x80\\x9351.93) per 100 000 population between 1990 and 2017. The association between socio-demographic index (SDI) and dengue-related DALYs suggested that the lowest age-standardised DALY rates were found in countries in the low and high-SDI quintile in 2017, and from 1990 to 2017, the age-standardized DALY rate tended to increase in regions with the lowest SDI but declined in regions with the highest SDI.

This study extends existing knowledge by assessing gender inequality in household food (in) security among small-holder farm households in urban and rural areas of South Africa. In doing-so, we use the gender of the head of household and treatment effects framework. Our results show that male-headed households are more food secure compared to female-headed households, with the latter depending more on agriculture to increase household food levels. We further find that the household food security gap between male- and female-headed households is wider in rural than in urban areas, where rural male- and female-headed households are more likely to report chronic food insecurity, i.e., are more likely than their urban counterparts to experience hunger. Interestingly, the effects of climatic characteristics on household food security are more apparent in rural than in urban areas. Our findings suggest that household food security initiatives are likely to be more effective, in closing the gender gap in household food security, if aligned with policies on urban and rural agriculture and development.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: food security; male-headed household; female-headed households; urban; rural; South Africa\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Fred M.

A series of significant developments have taken place in these sectors over the past decade that are positively associated with the promotion of HIA in the ROI. However, it is argued that in spite of various institutional facilitators, the practice of implementing HIAs in the ROI is significantly underdeveloped, and it continues to lag behind several of its European Union counterparts.

Environmental degradation often reduces property value in the housing market. However, the studies attempted to assess the value of environmental amenities and dis-amenities in the housing market of Bangladesh are scarce. Hence, this study examines the economic value of environmental (dis)amenities in the housing market of Khulna city, Bangladesh. Hedonic pricing method was used to assess the value of four environmental attributes - ventilation, open space, waterlogging and landfill by waste in the housing market. The study found these environmental attributes explain the variation of house rents significantly. Environmental amenities\\xe2\\x80\\x93a hundred-meter reduction in proximity to open space leads to a 2 percent increase in rent while a one discrete unit increase in a 5-point ventilation improvement scale from very poor to excellent results in 5.4 rent increase\\xe2\\x80\\x93are found as rent booster in the urban housing market. In contrast, waterlogging and landfill by waste reduce house rents by 3.7 and 9.8 percent for one unit increase in the respective 5-point degradation scales. The further analysis showed that the rental price of planned residential areas is more sensitive to ventilation and landfilling while that of unplanned areas is more sensitive to both environmental dis-amenities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 water-logging and landfilling. Furthermore, our study computed the implicit price of these environmental (dis)amenities in the housing markets of Khulna city. This study suggests improving environmental quality boosts house rent, which in turn attracts environment-friendly urbanization.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban environment; Hedonic pricing method; Marginal willingness to pay; Implicit price; Environmental amenities\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dominic A.

Despite their rising numbers, the living conditions and wellbeing of older Ghanaians remain woefully understudied. This paper presents the results of a study exploring the quality of life (QoL) of older adults in two contrasting neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana. The objectives of the study were to: (1) explore and compare the QoL of older slum and non-slum dwellers in Ghana; and (2) determine the extent of QoL disparities between slum and non-slum older adults. To accomplish these objectives, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of older adults (N = 603) residing in a slum and non-slum neighbourhood. QoL was self-assessed in four domains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 physical, psychological, social, and environment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 using the World Health Organization (WHO) QoL assessment tool (WHOQoL-BREF). Multivariable linear regression analyses of the data revealed no statistically significant difference between the slum and non-slum respondents in physical (coeff: 0.5; 95% CI: -1.7, 2.8;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.642) and psychological (coeff: -0.2; 95% CI: -3.0, 2.6;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.893) QoL. However, the slum respondents reported significantly higher social QoL than the non-slum respondents (coeff: -3.2; 95% CI: -5.6, -0.8;\\xe2\\x80\\xafp\\xe2\\x80\\xaf= 0.010), while the reverse was true in environmental QoL (coeff: 4.2; 95% CI: 2.3, 6.2; p < 0.001). The existence of strong social support systems in the slum and better housing and neighbourhood environmental conditions in the non-slum may have accounted for the observed variation in social and environmental QoL. Thus,\\xe2\\x80\\xafcontrary to popular discourses that vilify slums as health-damaging milieus, these findings offer a more nuanced picture, and suggest that some features of slums may constitute important health resources for older adults.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gina Chowa, David Ansong, Rainier Masa,\\r\\n',b'Assets and child well-being in developing countries: A research review,\\r\\n',b'Children and Youth Services Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 32, Issue 11,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1508-1519,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0190-7409,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.03.015.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740910000794)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: The impact of assets on child well-being in developing countries has received considerable attention in the last decade. Increased recognition of the critical role played by assets in enhancing children's well-being has spurred efforts to study the relationship between assets and a range of outcomes for children. This chapter reviews current studies (i.e., conducted within the past 10years) that explore the relationship between asset ownership and a range of outcomes. The studies we have included in this review illustrate the impact that assets can have on children's outcomes in the area of health, education, and child labor. Overall, the studies reviewed show that asset ownership improves children's health conditions, advance schooling outcomes, and decrease incidence of child labor. Further research on the asset effects for child outcomes can inform progressive asset-building initiatives that will provide impetus for programs and policies to enhance household well-being in developing countries.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Assets; Children; Developing countries; Child well-being\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Bj\\xc3\\xb6rn Gustafsson, Ding Sai,\\r\\n',b\"China's urban poor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Comparing twice poverty between residents and migrants in 2013 and 2018,\\r\\n\",b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 80,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'102012,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2023.102012.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X23000974)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Using data from the China Household Income Project in 2013 and 2018, this paper studies relative poverty among rural hukou holders living in urban China and urban hukou holders. People living in households with an income below a fixed percent of the median per-capita income and wealth below the same fixed percent of the median per-capita wealth among urban residents are deemed as relative poor. Although migrants with rural hukou living in urban China were more prone to twice poverty than urban residents in 2013, this was not generally the case in 2018. A multivariate analysis shows several factors to be related to the probability of being twice relative poor. Even considering these factors, a rural hukou status increased the probability of being twice relative poor in 2013. In contrast, such an excess risk of being twice relative poor was much lesser outspoken in middle and low-ranking cities in 2018. However, rural to urban migrants living in high-ranking cities had a somewhat higher risk of being relative poor than urban residents with the same characteristics in 2018.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Urban China; Rural to urban migrants; Urban residents; Twice poverty; China household income project\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'D.J.H. te Lintelo, J.

Sluggish growth in farm productivity in SSA has brought to the fore the key role of agricultural technology in alleviating future food insecurity. We develop a model of technology, food security and international trade with three distinct channels for technology reduce food insecurity in SSA. The first is via greater domestic R&D investment. An alternative is to import technologies from other countries with significant knowledge capital. The third role for technology to resolve the Malthusian dilemma in SSA is that of \\xe2\\x80\\x98virtual technology trade\\xe2\\x80\\x99, i.e., importing technological investments undertaken elsewhere through cheaper imported food. To assess the relative contribution of each channel to food security in Africa, we employ a partial equilibrium, quantitative trade model, augmented by a temporal relationship between R&D investments, knowledge capital and agricultural productivity. Over the historical period: 1991-2011 we find that direct R&D investments in SSA have been the dominant vehicle for lowering food prices in Africa. Looking forward to 2050, we find that virtual technology trade will be the most important vehicle for reducing non-farm undernutrition in Africa.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Population growth; Technological progress; Undernutrition; Malthus; Agriculture\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jessie X.

However, relevant studies in Chinese cities are rare. Little attention has been paid to accessibility modelling, variations among population groups, and the influence of land use arrangement and transport infrastructure in Chinese cities. To address this deficiency, the present paper provides measures on the job accessibility of workers with different hukou status in Guangzhou. The study yields the following findings: 1) inner-city districts have better job accessibility compared to suburban areas; 2) local hukou workers have significantly higher job accessibility than non-local hukou workers; 3) job suburbanization seems not to be effective in improving job accessibility or narrowing the gap between local and non-local hukou workers; and 4) investment in public transport would significantly improve the mobility and job accessibility of non-local hukou workers and help to alleviate accessibility inequality.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Land use; Mobility; Job accessibility; Hukou; Guangzhou\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Chaham Alalouch, Sara Al-Hajri, Abeer Naser, Asma Al Hinai,\\r\\n',b'The impact of space syntax spatial attributes on urban land use in Muscat: Implications for urban sustainability,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 46,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'101417,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2019.01.002.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670718306243)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: It is widely accepted that land-use distribution has a direct impact on urban sustainability. This study examines the relationship between land-use distribution and the spatial structure of street networks in newly developed neighborhoods as a contribution to urban sustainability. Two new neighborhoods in Muscat, Oman, were examined using Space Syntax theory. The land use maps were developed through exhaustive site visits, while the spatial analysis was generated using DepthMapX software. The following four spatial attributes were included: Integration, Control, Choice, and Normalized Least Angle Choice (NACH). The land use variables were Retail, Residential and Mix-use. The statistical analysis showed that the distribution of the Residential land use is significantly influenced by the spatial attributes in highly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintelligible\\xe2\\x80\\x9d spatial configurations, with NACH being the best predictor followed by Integration. In addition, the degree to which an area has a formal grid structure was found to have no effect on the relationship between the variables. Thus, this paper contributes to urban sustainability, Space Syntax, and land-use distribution studies by providing evidence on how spatial arrangements influence land-use distribution, and consequently, energy use, demand for services, and patterns of urban traffic. The study concludes with recommendations to the planning authorities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban sustainability; Land use; Space syntax; Street network; Oman; Integration; Normalized least angle choice\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Florence Abugtane Avogo, Emmanuel Akiweley Wedam, Seth Mensah Opoku,\\r\\n',b'Housing transformation and livelihood outcomes in Accra, Ghana,\\r\\n',b'Cities,\\r\\n',b'Volume 68,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 92-103,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.05.009.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275116308228)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: New trends in urban growth in Accra have put many poor households at a detriment, and there is a growing fragility that threatens the economic and social balance of residence in public estates resulting in many transforming their residence to cope and as a new form of urban resilience. This study examines housing transformation and livelihood outcomes in one of Ghana's largest low cost government estates, constructed in 1975 in Accra. The authors collected field data using questionnaires, interviews, observations and field pictures. The study revealed that housing transformation in public estates are a strategy to address shortfalls' associated with the physical design, structure and construction paucities, especially in living space, lifestyle and size, and for addressing pecuniary and livelihood challenges through home-based enterprises. Household needs and household assets were the significant factors affecting transformations. This study is important for policy making in developing countries because it provides a basis for policy implementation for urban and regional planners. Housing and building policies must be swotted to reflect the effort of local performance in housing supply and livelihoods.

This study examines how community socioeconomic status (SES) influences children's self-rated health and nutritional status in urban and rural China and explores whether the effects of community SES vary by a child's gender and family background. Using data from the China Family Penal Studies in 2010, this study focuses on children aged 10\\xe2\\x80\\x9315 years old living in 261 urban neighborhoods and 293 rural villages in China. Multilevel regression models are estimated to examine the effect of community SES on the probability of reporting poor/fair health and nutritional status measured by height for age while controlling for individual and family characteristics. The results suggest that community SES has a positive and curvilinear effect on children's health and nutritional status in urban China, and it only positively influences children's nutrition in rural China. Community SES has a stronger effect for boys than for girls, and for children in poorer families and families with lower levels of parental involvement.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: China; Community environment; Neighborhood effect; Children; Health inequalities; Nutrition\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Michael Adu Okyere, Felix Essel-Gaisey, Fawzia Muhammed Zuka, Aaron Kobina Christian, Isaac Kwamena Nunoo,\\r\\n',b'Wading out the storm: Exploring the effect of flooding on energy poverty amidst disaster management strategies in Dar es Salaam,\\r\\n',b'Environmental Science & Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 150,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'103578,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1462-9011,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2023.103578.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901123002277)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Although flooding is well-thought-out as one of the deadliest natural disasters, there is scarce evidence on how such an environmental shock affect energy poverty prevelence in a developing country context amidst the implementation of disaster risk management strategies. Using the Disaster Poverty Household Survey in Tanzania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital Dar es Salaam, we examine the effect of flooding on multidimensional energy poverty while estimating the moderation effects of non-structural ex-ante risk management strategies. After employing a myriad of robust methods, we observe that flooding increases energy poverty prevalence by about 32 %. The mediation analysis shows that income reduction serves as a pathway through which flooding affects energy poverty. Furthermore, estimates from the interaction analysis reveal how effective fiscal non-structural ex-ante risk management methods are in reducing the incidence of energy poverty among flood victims. However, the defense strategies were noted to be inefficient. These results provide policymakers with the necessary tools to create policies that address energy-related needs in areas affected by natural disasters, especially in developing countries.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Flooding; Ex-ante risk management strategies; Developing economy; Moderation analysis; Micro-level study\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Md.

Although different TOD typologies have been developed in different contexts, they are based on subjective evaluation criteria derived from the context in which they are built and typically lack a validation measure. Arguably there exist sets of TOD characteristics that perform better in certain contexts, and being able to optimise TOD effectiveness would facilitate planning and supporting policy development. This research utilises data from census collection districts (CCDs) in Brisbane with different sets of TOD attributes measured across six objectively quantified built environmental indicators: net employment density, net residential density, land use diversity, intersection density, cul-de-sac density, and public transport accessibility. Using these measures, a Two Step Cluster Analysis was conducted to identify natural groupings of the CCDs with similar profiles, resulting in four unique TOD clusters: (a) residential TODs, (b) activity centre TODs, (c) potential TODs, and (d) TOD non-suitability. The typologies are validated by estimating a multinomial logistic regression model in order to understand the mode choice behaviour of 10,013 individuals living in these areas. Results indicate that in comparison to people living in areas classified as residential TODs, people who reside in non-TOD clusters were significantly less likely to use public transport (PT) (1.4 times), and active transport (4 times) compared to the car. People living in areas classified as potential TODs were 1.3 times less likely to use PT, and 2.5 times less likely to use active transport compared to using the car. Only a little difference in mode choice behaviour was evident between people living in areas classified as residential TODs and activity centre TODs. The results suggest that: (a) two types of TODs may be suitable for classification and effect mode choice in Brisbane; (b) TOD typology should be developed based on their TOD profile and performance matrices; (c) both bus stop and train station based TODs are suitable for development in Brisbane.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Transit Oriented Development (TOD); TOD typology; Advanced TOD planning; Mode choice behaviour; Public transport accessibility level (PTAL); Brisbane\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Hans Binswanger-Mkhize, Alex F.

The secular downward trend in agricultural prices ended in the early 1990s; growing incomes in Asia and Africa, combined with continued rapid population growth, are fueling food demand, which is expected to lead to a gradual upward trend in international real agricultural prices. For Africa the major agricultural growth opportunities will be in regional and domestic markets for food staples. To seize these opportunities, SSA will have to support economic growth via continued sound macroeconomic policies, further improvements in the investment climate, and investments in infrastructure and institutions. In the agricultural sector SSA will have to (1) remove the remaining agricultural taxation that still disadvantages African farmers relative to all other farmers in the world, (2) improve its services for small farmers, (3) significantly increase its investment in agricultural technology generation and dissemination at national and subregional levels, (4) empower local governments, communities, and farmer organizations for their own development via further administrative and fiscal decentralization and community-driven development, and (5) strengthen the already existing regional agricultural institutions for agricultural trade, biosafety, phytosanitary regulations, seed production, regulation and trade, and technology generation.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dinghong Xu, Kashif Raza Abbasi, Khadim Hussain, Abdullah Albaker, Abdulaziz I.

Recently, the prediction for energy consumption has intensified compared to its production capacity, which is problematic for Pakistan's social and economic stability. Hence, it is vital to examine the link between power consumption, power prices, urban transition, other electricity use, and economic expansion from 1970 to 2018 in Pakistan. For analysis, the second-generation econometric technique of Lee and Strazicich (2013), novel Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag (AARDL), and Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) is useful to detect the long-medium and short-run association among the variables. The results show that power consumption stimulates economic expansion in the short and long-run, though the rise in power prices declines economic activity in the short and long-run. Also, urban transition and other electricity use are a substantial positive and negative impact on economic expansion in the short and long-run. The outcome suggests that efficient energy supply, low-cost power prices, proper urban transition management, and other energy use could be useful for policymakers to achieve SDGs 7 and 11 in Pakistan.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Power consumption; Power prices; Urban transition; Economic expansion; AARDL\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jane Wardani, Joannette J.

It is also imperative to understand its impact on a specific dimension of early childhood development, socioemotional development, beginning at an early age. Thus, the objective of this article was to conduct a systematic narrative review to examine the relationship between broader conceptions of SES and young children's social-emotional development. The findings suggest that SES begins to have a negative impact on social-emotional development early in life.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Anxiety; Child development; Depression; Infant mental health; Internalizing behavior; Poverty; Prosocial behavior; Social-emotional development; Socioeconomic status; Systematic narrative review; Withdrawn\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'S.

Across the globe, nearly one in ten people is without access to an improved drinking water source. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are the most affected, having disproportionately more of the global population without access to clean water than other major regions. Population growth, changing lifestyles, increasing pollution and accelerating urbanization will continue to widen the gap between the demand for water and available supply especially in urban areas, and disproportionately affect informal settlements, where the majority of SSA's urban population resides. Distribution and allocation of water will be affected by climate-induced water stresses, poor institutions, ineffective governance, and weak political will to address scarcity and mediate uncertainties in future supply. While attempts have been made by many scientists to examine different dimensions of water scarcity and urban population dynamics, there are few comprehensive reviews, especially focused on the particular situation in Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper contributes to interdisciplinary understanding of urban water supply by distilling and integrating relevant empirical knowledge on urban dynamics and water issues in SSA, focusing on progress made and associated challenges. It then points out future research directions including the need to understand how alternatives to centralized water policies may help deliver sustainable water supply to cities and informal settlements in the region.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban dynamics; Water scarcity; Water access; Governance; Sub-Saharan Africa; Population\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shuangshuang Tang, Pu Hao, Xianjin Huang,\\r\\n',b'Land conversion and urban settlement intentions of the rural population in China: A case study of suburban Nanjing,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 51,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 149-158,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.10.023.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751500226X)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Rapid urban expansion in China has created a large population of landless farmers. Because these landless farmers are under-compensated for land acquisition and discriminated against by urban institutions, many of them face tremendous difficulties in their urban lives. Consequently, rural citizens generally resist land acquisition and conversion to urban residency. However, given the recent improvements in land compensation standards, the educational qualifications of the rural population and urban employment opportunities, the situation is likely to change. Based on a 2014 survey conducted in Nanjing's suburban Jiangning District, this paper examines the land conversion and settlement intentions of rural citizens under the new circumstances. Both in-depth interviews with local villagers and regression models suggest that relinquishing farmland and housing land and settling in the city are distinct decisions determined by dissimilar factors. The findings suggest that a compensation scheme that integrates rural land requisition and resettlement allocation barely meets the requirements of the affected villagers, which explains the observed resistance of rural citizens to land conversion and urban settlement.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Land conversion; Rural migrants; hukou; Settlement intentions; Nanjing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'C.

Food banks, the primary response to food poverty on the ground, typically rely on community referral and distribution systems that involve health and social care professionals and local authority public health teams. The perspectives of these key stakeholders remain underexplored. This paper reports on a qualitative study of the health and wellbeing challenges of food poverty and food banking in London. An ethnographic investigation of food bank staff and users was carried out alongside a series of healthcare stakeholder interviews. A total of 42 participants were interviewed. A Critical Grounded Theory (CGT) analysis revealed that contemporary lived experiences of food poverty are embedded within and symptomatic of extreme marginalisation, which in turn impacts upon health. Specifically, food poverty was conceptualised by participants to: firstly, be a barrier to providing adequate care and nutrition for young children; secondly, be exacerbated by lack of access to adequate fresh food, food storage and cooking facilities; and thirdly, amplify existing health and social problems. Further investigation of the local government structures and professional roles that both rely upon and serve to further embed the food banking system is necessary in order to understand the politics of changing welfare landscapes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food poverty; London; Qualitative; Health inequalities; Food banks; Diet\\r\\n',b'\\n',b\"Achim Buerkle, Amy O'Dell, Harveen Matharu, Linda Buerkle, Pedro Ferreira,\\r\\n\",b'Recommendations to align higher education teaching with the UN sustainability goals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 A scoping survey,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Educational Research Open,\\r\\n',b'Volume 5,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'100280,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2666-3740,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2023.100280.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666374023000559)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Global challenges such as climate change, limited resources, and an ever-growing world population demonstrate a perceptible impact on the lives of people around the globe. To tackle the arising issues and to enable peace and prosperity in the future, the United Nations (UN) have defined 17 interlinked sustainable development goals. A major facilitator to achieve these goals is considered through education. Consequently, higher education institutes have started to align their curricula with sustainable development. Yet, lesser attention has been paid to teaching methods themselves. Hence, in this paper, a scoping survey is performed on how higher education teaching can be inspired by the UN sustainable development goals, specifically, by a summarized subset of 7 goals: (1) Tackle Poverty, (2) Enable Good Health and Well-Being, (3) Establish Quality Education, (4) Reduce Inequalities, (5) Embrace Environmental Sustainability, (6) Foster Innovation, and (7) Establish Partnerships. Overall, the discussed recommendations show a promising potential towards having a positive impact on higher education, yet, also unveil conflicts between different goals.

It has dramatically changed the policy landscape in the rice sector and generated heated debates on how it would affect food security and poverty. This study explores the welfare effects of this reform across different types of households. We rely on the IRRI Global Rice Model to simulate the domestic price effects of the reform (Bali\\xc3\\xa9 and Valera, 2020) and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to study the welfare impact of these price changes. Our results show that the RTL reduces consumer and producer rice prices, which affects households on the production and the consumption sides. Because a large majority of households are net buyers of rice and the policy reform reduces rice prices, most households benefit from the reform. Overall, the effects of the reform on poverty are beneficial. The poorest quintiles are positively affected, while the richest quintiles are unaffected or slightly worse-off. Spatially, the poorest regions also benefit the most. However, the rice growers who are net sellers are negatively impacted. The government should seek to mitigate the negative effects on non-competitive rice growers. Investments in public goods and services are a promising option to ease the emergence of on-farm and off-farm businesses as more profitable alternatives to rice production.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Welfare effects; Regional analysis; Price change; Rice policy; Philippines\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mingxing Chen, Yuwen Sui, Weidong Liu, Hui Liu, Yaohuan Huang,\\r\\n',b'Urbanization patterns and poverty reduction: A new perspective to explore the countries along the Belt and Road,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 84,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1-14,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.12.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751830852X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Urbanization and poverty reduction are two vital aspects for global sustainable and healthy development. In the future, the countries along the Belt and Road will play a more important role in global urbanization and poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper aims at elaborating the characteristics and patterns of urbanization and poverty reduction in these countries using data from 1996 to 2016. The results indicate that the average urbanization level is 48% in 2016 and the average annual growth rate of these countries is 0.61 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. In addition, West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have a higher level of urbanization, while ultra-high-speed and high-speed development countries are primarily Southeast Asian countries and China. Furthermore, these countries differentiate significantly in terms of spatial distribution of population density. Regions with a population density of 0\\xe2\\x80\\x931 person per square kilometer account for 33% of the total area and 0.09% of the total population, while regions with a population density of over 1000 people per square kilometer account for 1.45% of the total area and 39.56% of the total population. Moreover, using mathematical morphology methods, we identify the 10 regions with the largest urban land areas among these countries, and seven regions are located in China and Southeast Asia. Finally, the population living in extreme poverty in these countries dropped from 1.17 billion to 355.6 million during the 20-year period, and several countries, such as China, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, have made tremendous progress both in urbanization and poverty reduction. These findings are beneficial for comprehending urban development and poverty reduction in the countries along the Belt and Road as well as for providing references for regional cooperation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urbanization; Characteristic; Pattern; Poverty reduction; GIS; The Belt and Road\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Akwasi Kumi-Kyereme, Joshua Amo-Adjei,\\r\\n',b'Household wealth, residential status and the incidence of diarrhoea among children under-five years in Ghana,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health,\\r\\n',b'Volume 6, Issue 3,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 131-140,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6006,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jegh.2015.05.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210600615000581)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This study examines the impact that the joint effect of household wealth quintile and urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural residence has on the incidence of diarrhoea among Ghanaian children. Data for this paper were drawn from the Ghana Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) of 2006. Descriptive and logistic regression was applied to analyse data on 3466 children. Rural residents are less likely, albeit insignificant, to report diarrhoea compared with those in urban areas. Significant wealth gradients are manifested in childhood experiences of diarrhoea. However, an interaction of wealth with residence does not show significant disparities. Controlling for other important covariates of childhood, the odds of diarrhoea incidence were significantly higher among: the rural poorer (OR=4.869; 95% CI=0.792, 29.94), the rural middle (OR=7.477; 95% CI=1.300, 42.99), the rural richer (OR=6.162; 95% CI=0.932, 40.74) and the rural richest (OR=6.152; 95% CI=0.458, 82.54). Apart from residential status and wealth quintile, female children (OR=0.441; 95% CI=0.304, 0.640), older children (OR=0.968; 95% CI=0.943, 0.993), having a mother with secondary and higher education (OR=0.313; 95% CI) had lesser odds of experiencing diarrhoea. The findings show that there is a need to apportion interventions intended to improve child health outcomes even beyond residential status and household wealth position.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Wealth status; Residence; Diarrhoea; Children; Ghana\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Antonio Flavio Dias Avila, Luis Romano, Fernando Garagorry,\\r\\n',b'Chapter 71 Agricultural Productivity in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sources of Growth,\\r\\n',b'Handbook of Agricultural Economics,\\r\\n',b'Elsevier,\\r\\n',b'Volume 4,\\r\\n',b'2010,\\r\\n',b'Pages 3713-3768,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1574-0072,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780444518743,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S1574-0072(09)04071-7.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574007209040717)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Agricultural productivity in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries between 1961 and 2001 increased due to market regulation, economic openness, and estate reduction.

While it may have significant impacts on various dimensions of development and sustainability, this study focuses on its effect on the level of food security of the overall population (SDG 2). Although there are many reasons to suppose that electricity access is positively related to food security, such impacts are expected to accrue through both immediate and income-mediated routes whose size and prevalence are unknown. The immediate impacts of electricity access on food security refer to the effects on food production (availability) and on food conservation and preparation (utilization). Income-mediated impacts include cross-sectoral productivity increases and the creation of new economic activities, generating new income that, in turn, would improve the economic access to food. After theoretically discussing the two kinds of impacts, this work empirically verifies how the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1) is related to the percentage of population with access to electricity (SDG indicator 7.1.1) in a panel of 54 developing countries over the period 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932014. By adopting a multi-step estimation method, we disentangle the immediate effects of electricity access on food security from the income-mediated effects that stem from changes in GDP per capita and its distribution. Results show that electricity access mainly exerts immediate impacts on food availability and utilization, with only one fifth of impacts coming from income-mediated effects. This finding may lead policy-makers to prioritize off-grid electricity investments in proximity of vulnerable households through small-scale and household-level electricity systems, which may improve food security by immediately affecting the local and subsistence food production, conservation and preparation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Food security; Electricity access; Income distribution; Multi-step estimation\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Leopoldo Laborda, M.

There are numerous studies that examine the impact of urbanisation on the environment but no known study has analysed whether the impact of urbanisation on the environment is dependent on the characteristics of available infrastructure. To address this gap, this study uses the STIRPAT model, panel cointegration and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) estimator as well as panel data of eight Asian countries to analyse whether private sector investment in the transport sector and transport infrastructure mode influences the impact of urbanisation on transport CO2 emissions. We find that the effect of urbanisation on transport CO2 emissions depends on the covariates in the model and interactions with other factors. Increase in income and population increases transport CO2 emissions while technological improvements reduces CO2 emissions from the transport sector. Private sector investment in the transport sector and availability of rail infrastructure reduce transport CO2 emissions; and given the same level of urbanisation, Asian countries with more rail infrastructure and private sector investment in the transport sector tend to have lower CO2 emission from the transport sector. Policy makers in Asia should make efforts to boost private sector participation in the transport sector and also promote the construction and improvement of rail infrastructure in order to reduce urbanisation-induced transport CO2 emissions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urbanisation; Transport sector; Private sector investment; CO2 emission; Asia\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Anne-Claire Thomas, Fr\\xc3\\xa9d\\xc3\\xa9ric Gaspart,\\r\\n',b'Does Poverty Trap Rural Malagasy Households?,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 67,\\r\\n',b'2015,\\r\\n',b'Pages 490-505,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.11.012.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X14003702)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'This paper contributes to the understanding of the persistently high poverty rates in rural Madagascar.

Focussing on recent progress in revitalisation of industrial buildings in Hong Kong, this research investigates the Government regulations and market responses. It is found that simply relieving the regulations and institutional constraints in revitalisation does not work, either for the policy aim in a narrow sense or for the local economy in a broad sense. New revitalisation measures by the Government have led to new constraints in revitalisation. It is necessary to address the policy lag. This paper presents an opening statement of discussing effectiveness of revitalisation policy in terms of urban competitiveness. It advocates some general principles and goals been taken into account in making revitalisation policy, including industrial diversity, indigenously owned companies, social costs and quality of life.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Industrial building; Revitalisation; High-density; Policy evaluation; Hong Kong\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'F.L.

Ensuring a fair implementation process is important when considering an equitable PES scheme. Currently the implications, such as impacts on social dynamics and participant perceptions, of auctions at both the individual and community level are poorly understood. Using a case study a long-standing and well-established PES scheme in Sumberjaya, Indonesia, we aim to explore the relationship between farmer characteristics and their perceived auction fairness/satisfaction and impacts on the community social dynamics. We find that a fair auction process allowing all to participate leads to perceived fairness at the individual level. However, at the community level, we find that individuals perceive more social impacts. Our results also find that information quality is the main factor in increasing fairness and reducing community impacts. Our results suggest that while it is possible to have an equitable implementation process, ensuring procedural equity may potentially compromise contextual equity. These results can aid in the implementation of PES schemes and shed some light into which characteristics to identify within potential participants and communities to avoid social disruptions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Participant perceptions; Social dynamics; Justice; Conservation auction; Incentive-based conservation\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Simon Feeny, Lachlan McDonald, Alberto Posso,\\r\\n',b'Are Poor People Less Happy?

The impacts on reducing extreme income poverty and extreme multidimensional poverty are more significant for the rural sector than for the urban sector.

Three basic hypotheses are examined: migrants had false expectations about their future urban conditions, or about their future urban aspirations, or about their future selves.

This paper presents the economic modelling using Fiji's Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2002/03 dataset to examine the economic and social factors crucial for poverty reduction. Two hypotheses are tested: first, we estimate the monetary effects of education at the aggregate and disaggregated returns to education (primary, secondary, tertiary levels) and by income quartiles, and second, test the non-monetary education and health factors as channels of impact promulgated as effects against poverty prevalence. The monetary results indicate that all income quartile households (i.e. lowest to highest) benefit from additional skills obtained through formal education. While those at the lowest income quartile in particular benefit the most from formal education, however it cannot sustainably prevent people with only primary education from falling into poverty. The results for non-monetary models show that education has a positive and significant influence on the tendency of the people to engage in health prevention activities and in acquiring good housing facilities.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Poverty; Econometrics; Monetary models; Non-monetary models; Fiji\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ronald Oaxaca,\\r\\n',b'Discrimination, Economics of,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

In economics, as in ordinary parlance, discrimination typically carries a pejorative connotation. The term is generally reserved for distinctions that are socially unacceptable and economically inefficient. Economic theories of discrimination can be categorized into theories about tastes and preferences of economic agents, economic power, and statistical discrimination. Achieving a consensus on what the broad features of discrimination in markets, especially labor markets, should entail is a seemingly straightforward task compared with obtaining a consensus on empirical measures of discrimination. The standard measurement technique is that of wage decompositions. With the advent of newer and more sophisticated econometric methods for estimating earning relationships, measurement of discrimination has become more ambiguous. Legal and employee morale considerations constrain attempts to remove discrimination in the workplace in a way that would correspond to accepted economic principles of efficiency. Comparable worth seeks to remedy discrimination by relying upon experts to value job attributes in an unbiased manner. Empirical studies of labor-market discrimination are global in nature and encompass both developed countries and developing countries.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Consensus; Differentiation; Earnings potential; Income inequality; Median income; Monopsony power; Pejorative connotation; Reduced competition; Segregation; Wage decompositions\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'James M.

With the increasing number of households engaging in the practice, a local NGO in 2009 introduced community gardens in the city of Gweru to vulnerable households as a new development initiative. We examine the feasibility of community resource management in these gardens using a blend of econometrics and community resource management theory. The study finds that sex of head of household, household labour, on-plot area, and off-plot area significantly affected the decision to practice community gardening. Results also show that households characterised by food insecurity tended to be the participants in community gardens. Strong social capital made it possible for these households to participate in community management of resources. However, there is need to remove obstacles such as uncertainty of tenure. Given the potential of urban agriculture in alleviating food insecurity, urban authorities need to consider their position that the practice causes river siltation and include it in their planning processes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Key words; Binary logistic; Community gardens; Food security; Heterogeneity; Urban agriculture; Zimbabwe\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Wisdom Akpalu, Aaron K.

However, publicly managed hydro-modernist sanitation systems are not available to all, with many households and communities across the world having to access basic off-grid, state-provided sanitation services, such as pit latrines or Urine Diversion Dehydration Toilets, or having to provide their own solutions to sanitation waste. Urban green sanitation, which is non-sewered and off-grid, represents a new form of hydro-social and socio-technical relations. It aims to address sanitation backlogs and provide an alternative to centralised sanitation systems using ecological circularity. This paper categorises the social acceptability of urban green sanitation technologies into four main dimensions: social concerns, environmental concerns, the right to sanitation, and making a contribution to change.

I explain the positive correlation observed between slum growth and economic growth in cities with three IV-estimated structural elasticities. The number of low-income households in a city increases with wages with an elasticity of 1.7. Housing rents increase with housing demand with elasticities of 0.37 for non-slum housing and 0.07 for slum housing. Economic growth in cities thus causes slum growth because it attracts large number of low-income households who face higher rent growth for non-slum than slum housing. I further show that as economic growth improves households\\xe2\\x80\\x99 incomes nationwide, an income effect reduces the national slum share. Finally, I find that two policy-relevant counterfactuals significantly increase aggregate income by relocating households into high-wage cities: 1) slum upgrading in high-wage cities 2) reducing the elasticity of non-slum housing rents to housing demand shocks.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Housing; Slums; Urbanization; Brazil\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Tim Smeeding,\\r\\n',b'Poverty, Sociology of,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

Herein, we examine several approaches and concepts of poverty measurement. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, but all end up with some definition or description of poverty and the attributes of the poor. Also debated are the sociological theories of why poverty exists, and its relation to family, culture, and context. Sociologists have provided important tools for testing causal hypotheses concerning the explanations, causes, and cures for poverty regardless of how it is measured. These include place, culture, stratification, space, race, gender, imprisonment, and other popular theories of poverty in sociology. Sociological studies of poverty have both a rich heritage and have become an important area of research in increasingly unequal rich and poor societies.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Crime; Culture of poverty; Family structure; Mass imprisonment; Neighborhood effects; Poverty; Poverty line; Poverty measurement; Social mobility; Social stratification; Spatial inequality\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Atanasio Tembe, Fumihiko Nakamura, Shinji Tanaka, Ryo Arioshi, Shino Miura,\\r\\n',b'Travel Behavior of the Urban Poor: A Comparative Study between Maputo and Nairobi,\\r\\n',b'Transportation Research Procedia,\\r\\n',b'Volume 48,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1478-1492,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2352-1465,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.193.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146520306104)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Commuters from poor households face increased challenges in their daily mobility in Sub-Saharan African cities, yet studies on their travel behavior are rare. Most poor individuals resort to walking long distances because they cannot afford motorcycles, bicycles, or even a single bus trip. Using person-trip data, this paper tries to investigate travel behavior of the urban poor through a comparative study between Maputo City and Nairobi City. The logistic regression results showed some similarities and variations among the factors affecting the travel behavior of the urban poor in Maputo City and Nairobi City. The likelihood of choosing Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) over public transport decreased with ownership of motorcycles and private cars in both cities. Surprisingly, gender had no impact on the likelihood of selecting NMT either in Maputo or Nairobi. This might indicate that men and women are equally likely to walk. Variations were observed with respect to the effect of age and residence location. For example, while the likelihood of selecting NMT is positively correlated with the residential location in Maputo, a negative relationship was observed for Nairobi.

This paper examines whether differences in banking sector penetration across Indian districts explain the differences in firm start-ups in Indian informal sector. Our empirical strategy lies in examining the effect of the spread of banking facilities at the district level on new firm formation in the informal sector for the period 1994\\xe2\\x80\\x931995 to 2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932011. Our results confirm that local bank availability is associated with significant increase in enterprises in the informal sector and the effect is more pronounced for larger enterprises in the sector.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Banking development; Firm creation; Informal sector; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'M.

However, much remains unknown about activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in developing countries. Can we expect similarity between activity participation and travel behaviour of non-workers in different income group households in developing countries? How do the socio-demographic settings in India, for e.g., traditional gender roles and multi-member households, and land use context influence the activity-travel choices of non-workers in different income group households? The present study attempts to answer these questions by presenting a comparative analysis of activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in low-, medium-, and high-income households in Bangalore city, India. Using a primary activity-travel survey data, the study mainly compares the activity-travel behaviour of the three income-groups with respect to various activity-travel indicators. In addition, statistical models of daily out-of-home time allocation, trip chaining, and mode choice behaviour are estimated separately for the three groups to investigate the potential sensitivity of the groups to various factors influencing these behaviour indicators. The study findings suggest that the low-income group non-workers are more mobility-constrained than others, apparent from longer walk trip length and the lower dependency on other modes of transport. The low-income group appears to make more social stops than the other two groups, probably a reflection of social-connections due to the increased dependency on walking. However, the number of recreational and shopping stops made by this group appears to be significantly lower than the other two groups. Further, the influence of mixed residential development on low-income group individuals' maintenance and discretionary activity time allocation decision appears to be insignificant. Overall, the study suggests that future land use planning for Bangalore might ensure that all groups of individuals have equal access (in terms of travel time/distance) to basic facilities.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Activity-based analysis; Bangalore; India; Income groups; Non-workers\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jonathan Rigg, Albert Salamanca, Eric C.

This has been the experience in much of the global North and it was expected to occur as development proceeded in the global South. In East and Southeast Asia, however, smallholders have persisted in the face of rapid and profound social and economic transformation. This presents the core puzzle that the paper addresses: why has the farm-size transition not occurred in much of East and Southeast Asia? Why have smallholders stubbornly resisted the tide of economic history? The first half of the paper defines the smallholder and smallholding, sets out the historical evolution of smallholdings in the region, and explores the role of smallholders in national development. The second half of the paper explains the persistence of the smallholder through three explanatory lenses: the economics of smallholder farming; the role of farm policy; and the logics of smallholder-based livelihoods in a context of global integration. The paper concludes by setting out four possible rural futures for the wider East Asian countryside and smallholder.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: East Asia; Southeast Asia; Smallholder; Farm-size transition; History; Development\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David A.

We first find that contrary to recent findings, undocumented Latinos do not replace blacks at the bottom of the locational attainment hierarchy. Whites continue to end up in neighborhoods that are less poor and whiter than minority groups, while all minorities, including undocumented Latinos, end up in neighborhoods that are of similar quality. Second, the effects of socioeconomic status for undocumented Latinos are either similar to or weaker than disadvantaged blacks. These findings suggest that living in less desirable neighborhoods is a fate disproportionately borne by non-white Los Angeles residents and that in some limited ways, the penalty attached to being undocumented Latino might actually be greater than the penalty attached to being black.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Residential segregation; Documentation status\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ajay Sharma, S.

The research adopted a mixed-method case study model that combines secondary sources and primary data gathering through semi-structured interviews of 25 returned market survivors, supported by 15 expert interviews among local and other government officials, practitioners and academics who are engaged in disaster management and urban planning. The empirical data reveal the importance of strengthening social relationships and cohesion as well as the crucial role of social capital in all stages of disaster management processes: prevention and preparedness, planning, warning communication, physical and psychological impacts, emergency and disaster response, recovery and reconstruction; and how these collectively motivate the survivors' return decision.

The change was not significant across cities in terms of WASH availability during the survey years. The availability of WASH was poor, but accessibility was better in Mumbai. Chennai reported a reverse trend, where availability was better, but accessibility was poor. The overall level of WASH became significantly better in Mumbai during 2011-12 compared to 2004-05, but changes were minor in other cities. The cities with poor WASH performance (Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Chennai) exhibited more inequality compared to better performing cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi). The intra-city inequality is attributable to housing conditions, economic status, educational level, socio-religious affiliation, and occupational status.

While the positive relationship between trade liberalization and economic growth is generally well accepted, the impact of trade liberalization on poverty and income inequality is still unclear. The objective of this paper is to use real data and real trade agreements of the state of Pakistan, to examine the predictions made by trade models about the impact of trade liberalization on income inequality. To illustrate, the impacts of several alternative bilateral and regional free trade agreements are simulated on household income and income inequality in Pakistan. The results show that trade liberalization does not always lead to a decline in income inequality in the short run. Trade agreements that do improve income equality, favor agriculture and often hinge on a decline in urban and non-farm household income. In the long run, changes in income equality are more positive, suggesting that efforts might best be applied towards improving the mobility of labor and capital.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Income inequality; Trade liberalization; CGE modeling; Pakistan\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Matamyo Simwanda, Yuji Murayama,\\r\\n',b'Spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use change in the rapidly growing city of Lusaka, Zambia: Implications for sustainable urban development,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 39,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 262-274,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.039.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670717309186)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This study examines the spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use (urban-LU) change in the rapidly urbanising city of Lusaka, Zambia, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using geospatial tools and techniques. The results show that the city experienced rapid urban growth, with about a 233% increase in the total urban-LU area from 1990 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 2010. The results also show that urban-LU expansion was more intense during the 2000s than during the 1990s. Spatially, the city displays a disordered pattern of urban-LU associated with the pattern of major roads and the city centre, which draws its legacies from the colonial era. Lusaka has emerged as a highly unplanned city with approximately 40% of the city representing unplanned residential land use dominated by informal settlements (30%). The growth of commercial and industrial land use has also been consistent with high density residential land uses. The growth of planned residential, and public institutions and service land uses has been slow. The results further reveal spatial dependency of informal settlements on commercial and industrial, and planned medium to high density residential land uses.

Here, in the first in a Series of two papers, we discuss why slums are unhealthy places with especially high risks of infection and injury. We show that children are especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads to stunted growth and longer-term effects on cognitive development. We find that the scientific literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and health. This shortcoming is important because health is affected by factors arising from the shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone.

Employment decentralization and lack of affordable housing have resulted in many low-income households migrating to suburban areas, and as of today, the majority of the low-income population of metropolitan regions resides in the suburbs. Focusing on the Triangle Region, NC, this study systematically explores the changes in the geography of poverty and transit access over time to better understand how accessibility to transit has changed for the low-income residents. Spatial panel data models are also estimated to investigate the relationship between poverty and transit access at the neighborhood level and how it varies spatially and temporally, while accounting for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Results indicate that between 1990 and 2015, the outer-ring suburbs experienced the highest increase in both poverty and transit access, although improvements in transit access were lower in the recently urbanized areas within the outer-ring suburbs. Inner-ring suburbs experienced a substantial rise in poverty rate and low-income population, and a comparable increase in transit access. Central cities remained the areas with the highest poverty rate and transit access in the Triangle Region but experienced smaller changes over time compared to suburban areas. The findings of the econometric analysis suggest that poverty rate and transit access are not significantly related at the neighborhood level when time-invariant unobservable characteristics are accounted for.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty suburbanization; Accessibility; Public transportation; Spatial analysis; Spatial panel data model\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Lu Liu, Jiaming Fang, Meng Li, Md Altab Hossin, Yunfei Shao,\\r\\n',b'The effect of air pollution on consumer decision making: A review,\\r\\n',b'Cleaner Engineering and Technology,\\r\\n',b'Volume 9,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'100514,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2666-7908,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2022.100514.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666790822001197)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Rapid industrialization and urbanization trends have brought many challenges, one of the most acute of which is air pollution. Until recently, scholars have primarily focused on the toll that air pollution exacts through its health effects while ignoring air pollution's impact on consumer behavior. The scattered research in the recent year reveals that air pollution might influence consumers' decision-making process before, during, and after consumptions in both online and offline contexts. However, no research to our knowledge has reviewed the influence effect of air quality on consumer behaviors, which impedes the scholars and practitioners from acquiring knowledge from this emerging field. This informative review aims to collect and analyze the existing scattered research for air pollution effects on consumer decision-making behavior. This review illustrates that the impact of air pollution on consumer behavior is rather extensive, ranging from health risks to emotional changes, from changes in daily habits to individual and group consumption behaviors. We propose that future research can potentially explore the impact of air pollution on consumers' consumption experience and evaluation behavior and examine the differential impacts of air pollution on consumers' individual and group consumption decisions.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Consumer decision making; Air pollution; Stimulus-organism-response framework; Environmental psychology; Literature review\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'E.H.

In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban inequality; New economy; Spatial inequality; Spatiality; Scale\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Awudu Abdulai, Victor Owusu, John-Eudes A.

Data on Amazonian mothers and their children, household demography and economics and direct, weighed measures of household food availability and dietary intakes of mother\\xe2\\x80\\x93child pairs were collected from 51 households to address the following research questions: (1) is there evidence of food scarcity in this setting?; (2) are there differences in energy and protein adequacy between children and their mothers?; and, (3) which individual and household-level factors are associated with these mother\\xe2\\x80\\x93child differences in energy and protein adequacy? In this context of food scarcity, we found that the majority of children had more adequate energy (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.001) and protein (p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.001) intakes than their mothers. Multivariate OLS regression models showed that of the individual-level factors, child age and height-for-age were negatively associated with maternal-child energy and protein inequalities while maternal reproductive status (lactation) was positively associated with energy inequality. While there were no gender differences in dietary adequacy among children, boys had a larger advantage over their mothers in terms of protein adequacy than girls. Household food availability was related to maternal-child energy and protein inequalities in a curvilinear fashion with the lowest inequalities found in households with extremely low food availability and those with adequate food resources. This is the first study to quantify maternal-child dietary inequalities in a setting of food scarcity and demonstrates the importance of the household context and individual characteristics in understanding the degree to which mothers protect their children from resource scarcity.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Brazil; Amazon; Food security; Intra-household resource distribution; Parental investment; Nutrition; Food provisioning\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Amit Thorat, Reeve Vanneman, Sonalde Desai, Amaresh Dubey,\\r\\n',b'Escaping and Falling into Poverty in India Today,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 93,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 413-426,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2017.01.004.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X17300062)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'The study examines the dynamic nature of movements into and out of poverty over a period when poverty has fallen substantially in India.

Our measurement focuses on anti-social behavior in a Joy-of-destruction lab game. We find that only the religious treatment decreased the propensity to destroy the payoffs of others. Consistently, surveys show increased trust in the state and decreased support for extremism.

We found that Dibao participation rate increased during this period, but its mis-targeting rate also increased. In both years, the Dibao benefit gap remained substantial, accounting for about one quarter of the potential full post-Dibao income of all eligible families. Using a propensity score matching method to identify non-participating families comparable to participating families, we found that Dibao had significant poverty reduction effects in both years, and the effect was larger in 2007 than in 2002. However, Dibao was unable to eliminate poverty among its target population, with notable poverty rate, gap, and severity remaining in both years. Future policy reforms should focus on the improvement of Dibao's anti-poverty effectiveness by better targeting, narrowing the benefit gap, and addressing not only the poverty rate but also the poverty gap and severity.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Welfare; Targeting; Poverty; Dibao; China; Urban\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ismail Haque, Md Juel Rana, Priyank Pravin Patel,\\r\\n',b'Location matters: Unravelling the spatial dimensions of neighbourhood level housing quality in Kolkata, India,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 99,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'102157,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102157.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397518310257)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Z.

Concerning the impact of projected R&D investments on agricultural productivity, it is found that endogenous growth rates of land-augmenting technical change are comparably lower than the standard exogenous rates used in long term projections of agri-food markets.

Vulnerability, meaning susceptibility to harm, is attributable to social determinants that limit access to assets, leading to greater exposure and sensitivity to stressors and a limited capacity to adapt. Stressors and adaptation are intertwined because stressors deplete resources available for adaptation, while adaptation may erode resources available to respond to future stressors. We present empirical evidence demonstrating the interactions of multiple stressors and adaptations over time through a case study of indigenous farmers in highland Bolivia. We examine how farmers perceive the stress on their livelihoods, their strategies for adapting to these threats, and the influence of past adaptation and exposure on vulnerability under increasing climatic change. We find that vulnerability changes over time as multiple stressors, such as land scarcity and delayed seasonal rainfall, compound, simultaneously reducing access and demanding the expenditure of household assets for adaptation, including natural capital (water and land), human capital (including labor), and financial, physical, and social capital. To reduce vulnerability over time, constraints on access to key resources must be addressed, allowing households the flexibility to reduce their exposure and improve their adaptive capacity to the multiple stressors they confront.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Adaptation; Access; Livelihoods; Climate change; Andes; Bolivia; Agriculture; Multiple stressors\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'James W.N.

Ecosystem classification is an approach that entails quantifying the social and ecological processes that shape ecosystem conditions into logical and relatively homogeneous management units, making the potential for ecosystem-based decision support available to urban planners. The purpose of this study is to develop and propose a framework for urban forest ecosystem classification (UFEC). The multifactor framework integrates 12 ecosystem components that characterize the biophysical landscape, built environment, and human population. This framework is then applied at the neighbourhood scale in Toronto, Canada, using hierarchical cluster analysis. The analysis used 27 spatially-explicit variables to quantify the ecosystem components in Toronto. Twelve ecosystem classes were identified in this UFEC application. Across the ecosystem classes, tree canopy cover was positively related to economic wealth, especially income. However, education levels and homeownership were occasionally inconsistent with the expected positive relationship with canopy cover. Open green space and stocking had variable relationships with economic wealth and were more closely related to population density, building intensity, and land use. The UFEC can provide ecosystem-based information for greening initiatives, tree planting, and the maintenance of the existing canopy. Moreover, its use has the potential to inform the prioritization of limited municipal resources according to ecological conditions and to concerns of social equity in the access to nature and distribution of ecosystem service supply.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Ecosystem classification; Urban forest; Neighbourhood; Management; Cluster analysis\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sabato Vinci, Ioannis Vardopoulos, Luca Salvati,\\r\\n',b'A tale of a shrinking City?

Urbanization without industrialization or, more frequently, a \\xe2\\x80\\x98late and light\\xe2\\x80\\x99 industrialization prevented a specific interpretation of metropolitan dynamics in Mediterranean basin according with the paradigm of \\xe2\\x80\\x98industrial shrinkage\\xe2\\x80\\x99. For the first time in the recent history, the great recession was a factor leading to metropolitan decline in Southern Europe and, after more than one decade, its outcomes can be investigated considering sufficiently long time series of demographic indicators that assess natural population growth and migration rates. Benefiting from quantitative information derived from official statistics, the present study describes medium- and short-term demographic transformations in a large metropolitan region (Attica, Greece) in response to the great recession. After an uninterrupted growth lasting more than one century, the last decade (2010\\xe2\\x80\\x932019) has provided a dynamic representation of regional population decline based on the interplay of long-term factors (aging, low fertility) and concomitant short-term disturbances (counter-urbanization and crisis-driven emigration). By delineating the most relevant socio-demographic mechanisms at the base of recent urban decline, our study contributes to (re)formulate short-term development scenarios in large metropolitan regions, shedding further light on crisis-driven shrinkage in Southern Europe.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Demographic decline; Migration balance; Population age structure; Recession; Urban resilience; Mediterranean Europe\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Irfan Ahmad Rana, Ihtisham Ul Haq Khan Niazi, Zainab Khalid, Adnan Nawaz, Fawad Ahmed Najam,\\r\\n',b'A novel framework to assess multidimensional disaster resilience of children: From conceptualization to quantification,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n',b'Volume 96,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'103914,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103914.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420923003941)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Children are a particularly vulnerable group in disaster situations, yet they are often overlooked in disaster management planning. To address this issue, a multilevel and multidimensional children resilience (MCR) framework is proposed in this study to assess the resilience of children in disaster situations. The framework takes into account four stages and five dimensions of resilience, which represent the layered reality and layered protection experienced by children. The study was conducted in four neighborhoods within the provincial capital of Peshawar, Pakistan. The selected areas exhibited distinctive urban and rural characteristics and were frequently exposed to natural hazards such as floods and earthquakes. The study employed a household questionnaire survey, targeting children as primary respondents. The proposed framework was validated by constructing the Multidimensional Children Disaster (MCR) Resilience Index. The results of the study demonstrate significant variations among all five dimensions of resilience. The proposed framework provides detailed and interactive perspectives on children's disaster resilience, emphasizing that disaster resilience is an integrated approach, which requires an integrated and holistic investigation. The proposed framework and methodology are replicable and can be used to quantify children's resilience and identify specific dimensions that can be enhanced through appropriate disaster risk reduction strategies.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Children disaster risk reduction; Multidimensional children resilience (MCR); Flood; Earthquake; Urban\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Lorena Pasquini, Lisa van Aardenne, Christie Nicole Godsmark, Jessica Lee, Christopher Jack,\\r\\n',b'Emerging climate change-related public health challenges in Africa: A case study of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,\\r\\n',b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n',b'Volume 747,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'141355,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141355.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348841)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Heat has the potential to become one of the most significant public health impacts of climate change in the coming decades. Increases in temperature have been linked to both increasing mortality and morbidity. Cities have been recognized as areas of particular vulnerability to heat's impacts on health, and marginalized groups, such as the poor, appear to have higher heat-related morbidity and mortality. Little research has examined the heat vulnerability of urban informal settlements residents in Africa, even though surface temperatures across Africa are projected to increase at a rate faster than the global average. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through a mixed-methods analysis of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The heat exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of informal settlement residents were assessed through a combination of climate analyses, semi-structured interviews with local government actors and informal settlement residents, unstructured interviews with health sector respondents, a health impacts literature review, and a stakeholder engagement workshop. The results suggest that increasing temperatures due to climate change will likely be a significant risk to human health in Dar es Salaam, even though the city does not reach extreme temperature conditions, because informal settlement residents have high exposure, high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to heat, and because the heat-health relationship is currently an under-prioritized policy issue. While numerous urban planning approaches can play a key role in increasing the resilience of citizens to heat, Dar es Salaam's past and current growth and development patterns greatly complicate the implementation and enforcement of such approaches. For African cities, the findings highlight an urgent need for more research on the vulnerability and resilience of residents to heat-health impacts, because many African cities are likely to present similar characteristics to those in Dar es Salaam that increase resident's vulnerability.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Heat; Health impacts; Vulnerability; Climate change; Africa\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sunyoung Kim, Jennifer A.

Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) is an important and often traditional livelihood in the rural global south where income generating alternatives are scarce. Marmato is one of South America's oldest gold mining sites, and ASM has been intermittently practiced there since about 500 B.C. The present study maps ASM onto the five capitals of the SLF and identifies several forms of capitals that miners cited as the most relevant for pursuing ASM activities. The results show that artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Marmato strategically combine different forms of capital that enable them to make a living from mining; however, there are key factors that may impact the longer-term viability of artisanal and small-scale mining livelihoods. Although human, social, and financial capital function to support ASM livelihoods, the finite nature of natural capital and deterioration of physical capital erode the potential for sustainability of those livelihoods. This research highlights the utility of closely examining the capitals in the SLF and suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of ASM capitals can better inform formalization policies and associated development interventions.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Artisanal and small-scale mining; Sustainable livelihoods framework; Formalization; Colombia; Social capital\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Richard Kwabena Nkrumah, Francis Kwaw Andoh, Joshua Sebu, Samuel Kobina Annim, Peter Yeltume Mwinlaaru,\\r\\n',b'COVID-19 water and electricity subsidies in Ghana: How do the poor benefit?,\\r\\n',b'Scientific African,\\r\\n',b'Volume 14,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'e01038,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2468-2276,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2021.e01038.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227621003392)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This paper investigates the extent of welfare distribution amongst households in Ghana due to the government's subsidies on electricity and water as part of its relief package to households on the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study seeks to induce policy discussions on effective targeting and the consequential welfare distribution of subsidy interventions in Ghana. Subsidising the price of basic household necessities is expected to immensely benefit the poor whose expenditure is largely occupied by these necessity goods, but, as pertains in developing countries, schemes for effective targeting of the poor are nearly non-existent. This mostly leads to misalignments in income redistribution that is eventually anti-poor. Data from Ghana Living Standard Survey (seventh wave) which captures household final expenditure on goods and services in 2017, including electricity and water, is used for the analysis. First, we simulate household consumption changes as a result of the pandemic on the 2017 data, using on real-time information in the course of the pandemic on household income and expenditure changes. Next, we estimate a complete demand system for all households, and their elasticities of demand for electricity, water and food using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System model. Using the computed elasticities, Taylor's approximations are then used to simulate consumer welfare in the form of compensating variation (CV) from price changes due to government subsidies. Our results indicate that the imposed subsidies promote consumer welfare of all households, especially, households living in rural areas. The blanket subsidy on water better identified the poor and the lifeline households than the subsidy on electricity which had a yardstick for targeting. However, we find that the subsidies on the household utilities are regressive in the sense that lifeline consumer households and the poorest households in both urban and rural areas are rather less advantaged in welfare redistribution in both subsidies.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Public health; COVID-19; Welfare; Subsidies; Electricity; Water; Ghana\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Carlos A.

The aim of this paper is to provide a case study on how community participation has proven to be an efficient way of procuring the basic needs of a poor community, such as those involved in providing daily mobility despite the apparent lack of a clear public transport policy. Results indicate that community participation and engagement in a common need can not only provide badly needed means of transportation but also be the impetus to tackle greater transport problems at the policy level. This, as a result, led to better CT which brought about greater accessibility to poor urban neighborhoods and more hands-on government engagement even though it operated only for a short period of time mainly to facilitate the entrance of the public transportation service.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Informal transport; Community participation; Community transport; Social exclusion; Urban accessibility\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ben Brisbois, Katrina Plamondon,\\r\\n',b'The possible worlds of global health research: An ethics-focused discourse analysis,\\r\\n',b'Social Science & Medicine,\\r\\n',b'Volume 196,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 142-149,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0277-9536,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.034.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617306998)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Representations of the world enable global health research (GHR), discursively constructing sites in which studies can legitimately take place. Depoliticized portrayals of the global South frequently obscure messy legacies of colonialism and motivate technical responses to health problems with political and economic root causes. Such problematic representations of the world have not yet been rigorously examined in relation to global health ethics, a major site of scholarly effort towards GHR that promotes justice and fairness. We carried out a discourse analysis of four guidance documents relevant to the ethical practice of GHR, purposively selecting texts covering different genres (UN documents and journal articles) and prominent GHR foci (HIV and clinical trials). In light of increasing acknowledgement of the lessons Indigenous health scholarship holds for global health ethics, the four analyzed texts also included a set of principles developed to support Indigenous nation-building. Three of four documents featured global disparities as reasons for ethical caution. These inequalities appeared without explanation or causes, with generation of new scientific knowledge following as a logical response to such disparities. The fourth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Indigenous health-focused \\xe2\\x80\\x93 document clearly identified 'colonialism' as a reason for both inequities in society, and related harmful research practices. Solutions to disparities in this text did not necessarily involve cutting-edge research, but focused instead on empowerment and responsiveness to community priorities and needs. These contrasting representations of the world were accomplished in ways that depended on texts' 'participants', or the people they represented; specific vocabularies or language usages; intertextual relationships to prior texts; and overall objectives or intentions of the author(s). Our results illustrate how ethics and other guidance documents serve as an important terrain for constructing, naturalizing or contesting problematic representations of the world of GHR.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Global health; Ethics; Discourse analysis; Imaginative geographies; Colonialism; Equity; Indigenous\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Vaishali Gijre, Sanjay Gupta,\\r\\n',b'Urban Transport Governance Practice and Challenges in an Emerging Economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Case Study of India,\\r\\n',b'Transportation Research Procedia,\\r\\n',b'Volume 48,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'Pages 2435-2445,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2352-1465,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2020.08.293.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146520307134)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: India is witnessing rapid urbanization with 31% of country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population in urban areas which have witnessed a growth rate of 3.16% per annum. Projections (Census 2011) are that by 2031, about 600 million Indians will reside in urban areas, an increase of over 200 million in just 20 years. This Urban India is expected to contribute about 75% to GDP by 2030, up from 63% in 2014. These changes have placed heavy demands on urban transport systems, and to facilitate this, what is required is a sound urban transport policy which can be understood and implemented by officials who are part of the institutional set-up for effective governance. The importance of appropriate transport institutional framework is critical to implementing informed policy decisions. India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urban transport governance currently has fragmented authority, limited institutional support and capacity for creating a transport system that can be leveraged for urban planning, environment, and social goals (including, in particular, limited scope for coordination between land use planning and transport system development), and lack of channels for broad input from local citizens and businesses. This paper attempts to critically analyze the emerging mobility challenges consequent to urbanization pattern in India. It provides an overview of the best urban transport governance practices across the globe and identifies key takeaways in urban transport governance for cities in the developing world such as India for possible adoption.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Transport Governance; Urbanisation; Transport Development\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gerard Bodeker,\\r\\n',b'Health Care of Indigenous Peoples/Nations,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Stella R.

At the same time as representing around 5% of the world's population, indigenous peoples comprise approximately a third of the world's 900million extremely poor rural people. Loss of traditional lands, political and social marginalization, introduction to alcohol and other drugs of addiction, and reduced access to traditional food supplies have resulted in greatly increased susceptibility to disease. Common health risk factors include high tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, poor nutrition, low income, limited education, high unemployment, high levels of stress, social marginalization, inadequate working conditions and housing, and gender-related challenges. Leading communicable diseases include tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, and C, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, malaria, infant diarrhea, and respiratory disease. Successful public health programs are typically based on self-sufficiency, incorporation of traditional cultural practices or practitioners, and equitable partnerships between agencies and indigenous communities.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Aboriginal health; Colonization; Indigenous health; Indigenous peoples; Native peoples; Traditional culture; Traditional medicine\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gizachew Berhanu, Solomon Mulugeta Woldemikael, Ephrem Gebremariam Beyene,\\r\\n',b'The interrelationships of sustainable livelihood capital assets deprivations and asset based social policy interventions: The case of Addis Ababa informal settlement areas, Ethiopia,\\r\\n',b'Research in Globalization,\\r\\n',b'Volume 4,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'100081,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2590-051X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resglo.2022.100081.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590051X22000028)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The purpose of the research is to analyze the pattern of interrelationships in deprivations of sustainable livelihood capital assets, sub-groups deprivation variations in light of the theoretical and empirical frameworks, and suggest recommendations for Asset Based Social policy (ABS). The research reviews the approaches of informal settlement interventions vis-a-vise livelihood capital assets, how livelihood capital assets deprivations affect each other, the relationships of assets and functioning of capability, and the institution role on access and control of assets by vulnerable sub-groups. The case study area was from two informal settlements of Addis Ketema sub-city Wereda 07 (the inner-city slum) and kolfe keranyo sub-city Wereda 03 (peri-urban). The research applied an explanatory mixed-method sequential design consisting of quantitative research based on a house-to-house random sampling survey, followed by the qualitative method of individual case study and key-informants interview. The research refined strategic issues/ indicators that require ABS interventions from the many aspects of deprivations relationships and argued in line with the theoretical and empirical frameworks. The research implicated strengthening institutions to make livelihood capital assets closer to vulnerable sub-groups, especially in peri-urban, empowering community associations bargain for poor rights, reinforce capability functioning for livelihood capital asset accumulation. ABS is crucial for addressing the strategic issue of livelihood capital assets deprivations, tackling institutional and legal constraints, effective functioning of assets and capability, address risk, safety, and vulnerability in informal settlements. The ABS policy improves the wellbeing of poor and vulnerable sub-groups through asset accession, asset valorization, and asset consolidation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Livelihood capital assets deprivations; Asset-Based Social Policy; Sub-groups; Capability; Institution\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ietza Bojorquez, Cecilia Rosales, Alexandra Angulo, Jill de Zapien, Catalina Denman, Hala Madanat,\\r\\n',b'International migration and dietary change in Mexican women from a social practice framework,\\r\\n',b'Appetite,\\r\\n',b'Volume 125,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 72-80,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0195-6663,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2018.01.024.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317309571)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Migration from lower- and middle-income to high-income countries is associated with dietary change, and especially with the adoption of a modern, less healthy diet. In this article we analyze the dietary changes experienced by Mexican migrants, employing as a theoretical framework the concept of social practice. According to this framework, practices integrate material elements, meanings and competences that provide their conditions of possibility. Practices are shared by members of social groups, and interact with other competing or reinforcing practices. Between 2014 and 2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 women, international return migrants living in Tijuana, Mexico. The interview guide asked about history of migration and dietary change. We found three main areas of dietary change: from subsistence farming to ready meals, abundance vs. restriction, and adoption of new food items. The first one was associated with changes in food procurement and female work: when moving from rural to urban areas, participants substituted self-produced for purchased food; and as migrant women joined the labor force, consumption of ready meals increased. The second was the result of changes in income: participants of lower socioeconomic position modified the logic of food acquisition from restriction to abundance and back, depending on the available resources. The third change was relatively minor, with occasional consumption of new dishes or food items, and was associated with exposure to different cuisines and with learning how to cook them. Public health efforts to improve the migrants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 diets should take into account the constitutive elements of dietary practices, instead of isolating individuals from their social contexts.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Dietary practices; Dietary change; Migration; Social practice; Mexico; Women\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kevin Fox Gotham,\\r\\n',b'Touristic disaster: Spectacle and recovery in Post-Katrina New Orleans,\\r\\n',b'Geoforum,\\r\\n',b'Volume 86,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 127-135,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0016-7185,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.09.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718517302646)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This paper develops the concept touristic disaster asa heuristic device to examine the conflictual and contradictory aspects of showcasing disaster-devastated neighborhoods as tourist attractions.

WAVE was launched in the summer of 2011 to: 1) explore adolescents' perceived health and their top health challenges; and 2) describe the factors that adolescents perceive to be related to their health and health care utilization. Researchers in each site conducted in-depth interviews among adolescents; community mapping and focus groups among adolescents; a Photovoice methodology, in which adolescents were trained in photography and took photos of the meaning of \\xe2\\x80\\x98health\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in their communities; and key informant interviews among adults who work with young people. A total 529 participants from across the sites were included in the analysis. Findings from the study showed that gender played a large role with regards to what adolescents considered as their top health challenges. Among females, sexual and reproductive health problems were primary health challenges, whereas among males, tobacco, drug, and alcohol consumption was of highest concern, which often resulted into acts of violence. Personal safety was also a top concern among males and females from Baltimore and Johannesburg, and among females in New Delhi and Ibadan. Factors perceived to influence health the most were the physical environment, which was characterized by inadequate sanitation and over-crowded buildings, and the social environment, which varied in influence by gender and site. Regardless of the study site, adolescents did not consider physical health as a top priority and very few felt the need to seek health care services. This study highlights the need to focus on underlying structural and social factors for promoting health and well-being among adolescents in disadvantaged urban environments.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban health; Adolescent health; Physical environment; Social environment; Health seeking behaviors; Global health\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Clement J.

A multilevel model is used to analyze survey data of about 90,000 households distributed across 150 towns/tehsils. Empirical estimates show that the vulnerability rate is higher than the rate of poverty, and poverty-induced vulnerability is higher than risk-induced vulnerability. Moreover, idiosyncratic-vulnerability is higher than covariate-vulnerability. Unlike previous studies that find poverty to be a rural phenomenon, this research shows that poverty and vulnerability are equally high in urban areas. A high level of urban vulnerability adds urgency to anti-poverty interventions given a rapid urbanization in Pakistan.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Vulnerability; Multilevel model; Idiosyncratic and covariate shocks; Punjab; Pakistan\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mengbing Du, Mengxue Zhao, Yang Fu,\\r\\n',b'Revisiting urban sustainability from access to jobs: Assessment of economic gain versus loss of social equity,\\r\\n',b'Environmental Impact Assessment Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 85,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'106456,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0195-9255,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2020.106456.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925520301967)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This study has aided an understanding of how the built environment impacts multiple facets of sustainability from perspective of job access that potentially assist in environmental protection, economic development, and social justice. However, the latter two contributions entail tradeoffs that are little-discussed in empirical research. We elaborate upon the manner in which job access affects economic and social sustainability and focus on tradeoffs between the two. We measure and characterize the impact of job access on housing prices and the spatial distribution of disadvantaged populations across New York City, using census data. Results document not only that there are significant positive effects of job access on housing but also that higher housing prices screen out disadvantaged populations and undermine social equity. Findings highlight the paradox in sustainable development that job access seldom exhibits simultaneous positive effects on economic and social equity. We propose that urban built environment might have sigificantimpact on and might be a solution to the tension between economic benefits and social loss regarding job accessibility. That is, appropriate spatial land use planning and public policies could maximize individual welfare and sustainability for future cities-a new perspective of achieving urban sustainability. The major challenge is finding a workable balance between economic and social sustainability that is theoretically sound and empirically feasible.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Job access; Sustainability; Urban built environment; Economic development; Social equity\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kate Bird, Bastien Chab\\xc3\\xa9-Ferret, Alexandre Simons,\\r\\n',b'Linking human capabilities with livelihood strategies to speed poverty reduction: Evidence from Rwanda,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 151,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'105728,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105728.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21003430)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Acute land scarcity in Rwanda limits poor people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to accumulate and move out of poverty. Options for livelihood diversification are restricted by the absence of a vibrant and job-rich non-farm rural economy, and by high rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban inequality which makes the urban economy somewhat inaccessible, particularly given the regulated nature of the urban informal sector, limiting opportunities for migration. Competition for employment is made more challenging by low capabilities, which place high-return jobs beyond reach for many poor people. This paper relies on mixed methods research to explore a land-education-jobs nexus and identify the linked human capital and livelihood determinants of poverty escapes to understand the factors slowing poverty reduction in Rwanda. The quantitative analysis uses three waves of nationally representative panel data between 2010/11 and 2016/17 to investigate correlates of poverty trajectories. The qualitative analysis uses content analysis to explore life histories, focus group discussions and key informant interviews from 14 study sites to explore factors driving change in livelihoods and well-being. Our findings show that the triple challenges of acute land scarcity, low capabilities and a sluggish non-farm economy lock together to form a nexus which limits sustained poverty escapes. In the regression analysis, households headed by primary school graduates are half as likely to be poor as those headed by a primary school dropouts while secondary completion or higher virtually eliminates the risk of poverty. Despite demand, secondary school completion in the fieldwork is beyond the reach of most children from poor households, limiting their later options for livelihood diversification. Near landlessness constrains accumulation and Rwanda\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thin rural non-farm economy provides few jobs or opportunities for self-employment. Rebooting poverty reduction in Rwanda particularly following the Covid-19 pandemic will require finding ways to sustain poverty escapes through fuelling job-rich \\xe2\\x80\\x98growth from below\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by generating additional demand in the rural economy, continuing to boost agricultural productivity and including even the poorest peasant farmers in that, creating a more conducive business environment for small enterprises and continuing to stimulate investment in job-rich enterprise. Underpinning these strategies should be strengthened efforts to enhance capabilities, education quality, and progression into secondary education.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty dynamics; Education; Land scarcity; Non-farm employment\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'S.

Numerous cities in several developing countries have implemented CDSs. However, in several cases, a mismatch was found between the formulated strategies and CDS implementation. The CDS in Qazvin City was instigated in order to address problems in the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urban planning system. As the project progressed, the CDS became the primary mechanism through which the city resolved emergent urban development challenges. In light of the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limited experience with CDS implementation, we thought it prudent to investigate the factors that would facilitate successful CDS implementation in the Iranian context. The predictive factors of successful CDS implementation have previously been identified in the CDS literature. We surveyed all participants during the CDS planning process. Local authorities, central government officials, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local experts comprised the pool of respondents. For this study, we employed the partial least squares \\xe2\\x80\\x93 structural equation modeling technique to analyze the data. The results showed a positive relationship between the success factors and the CDS implementation in Qazvin. Consensus building, effective participation, institutionalization, leadership, and capacity building are the determining factors of successful CDS. These factors have a positive and strong effect on CDS implementation. Our findings aid in identifying successful CDS planning system guidelines in the context of Qazvin and Iran.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: City Development Strategy (CDS); Success factors; CDS implementation; Qazvin; Iran\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jorge E.

Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Satellite remote sensing; Urban settings; Regional science applications\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Erick O.

Four such settlements in Kisumu, Kenya are analyzed to determine the extent to which water handling hygiene practices constitute a function of CP. Basic 2 by 2 contingency tables and commensurate Chi-square tests are employed. The results, which were statistically significant at p\\xc2\\xa0<\\xc2\\xa00.01, confirmed the hypotheses.

Those in the former group reported fewer incidences of waterborne diseases as well as less instances of odor in water than those of the latter. The findings lend credence to a less-known reason for community participation (CP), namely promoting and protecting the hygienic quality of potable water.

In the coming years, it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders. This, however, requires finding viable solutions to a number of complex technical, institutional, and policy issues, including land markets, research on seeds and inputs, agricultural extension, credit, rural infrastructure, connection to markets, rural non-farm employment, trade policy and food price stabilization. This paper reviews what the economic literature has to say on these topics. It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors, the determinants of the Green Revolution and the foundations of agricultural growth, issues of income diversification by farmers, approaches to rural development, and issues of international trade policy and food security, which have been at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in recent years.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Economic development; Agricultural policy; Sustainable development; Rural poverty reduction; Incomes policy and price policy; Agricultural R&D; Technology and extension services\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Hudda Khaleeq Khan, Muhammad Yasir Abdur Rehman, Riffat Naseem Malik,\\r\\n',b'Fate and toxicity of pharmaceuticals in water environment: An insight on their occurrence in South Asia,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Environmental Management,\\r\\n',b'Volume 271,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'111030,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0301-4797,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.111030.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479720309580)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Pharmaceutically active compounds are newly recognized micropollutants which are ubiquitous in aquatic environment mainly due to direct discharge of treated and untreated wastewater from wastewater treatment plants. These contaminants have attracted mounted attention due to their toxic effects on aquatic life. They disrupt biological processes in non-target lower organisms upon exposure. Biodegradation, photo-degradation, and sorption are key processes which determine their fate in the environment. A variety of conventional and advanced treatment processes had been extensively investigated for the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater. However, due to structural complexity and varying operating parameters, complete removal seems ideal. Generally, due to high energy requirement of advanced treatment technology, it is considered cost ineffective. Transport of pharmaceutical compounds occurs via aquatic channels whereas sediments and aquatic colloids play a significant role as sinks for these contaminants. The current review provides a critical understanding of fate and toxicity of pharmaceutical compounds and highlights their vulnerability and occurrence in South Asia. Antibiotics, analgesics, and psychiatric drugs were found predominantly in the water environment of South Asian regions. Despite significant advances in understanding pharmaceuticals fate, toxicity, and associated risks since the 1990s, still substantial data gaps in terms of monitoring, human health risks, and legislation exist which presses the need to develop a more in-depth and interdisciplinary understanding of the subject.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Pharmaceutical compounds; Fate; Toxicity; Risk assessment; Antibiotic resistance; South-Asia\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rongxing Guo,\\r\\n',b'Chapter 8 - Economic Growth and Income (Re)distribution,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Rongxing Guo,\\r\\n',b'Understanding the Chinese Economies,\\r\\n',b'Academic Press,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 125-143,\\r\\n',b'ISBN 9780123978264,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397826-4.00008-1.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123978264000081)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Justin Stoler, Rawan al Dashti, Francis Anto, Julius N.

Many other febrile illnesses, including bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, share a similar symptomatology as malaria and are routinely misdiagnosed as such; yet growing evidence suggests that much of the burden of febrile illness is often not attributable to malaria. Dengue fever is one of several viral diseases with symptoms similar to malaria, and the combination of rapid globalization, the long-standing presence of Aedes mosquitoes, case reports from travelers, and recent seroprevalence surveys all implicate West Africa as an emerging front for dengue surveillance and control. This paper integrates recent vector ecology, public health, and clinical medicine literature about dengue in West Africa across community, regional, and global geographic scales. We present a holistic argument for greater attention to dengue fever surveillance in West Africa and renew the call for improving differential diagnosis of febrile illness patients in the region.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Africa; Ghana; Malaria; Dengue; Febrile illness\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Adam Chamberlain,\\r\\n',b'Fusion ballots as a candidate-centered reform: Evidence from Oregon,\\r\\n',b'The Social Science Journal,\\r\\n',b'Volume 49, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 458-464,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0362-3319,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soscij.2012.07.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0362331912000596)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article argues that fusion balloting, or the ability of multiple parties to nominate a single candidate for office, can be viewed as a candidate-centered and incumbent-oriented reform. Using the recent passage of fusion legislation in Oregon in 2009 and its subsequent use in 2010 state legislative elections as a test case, I study the factors behind supporting fusion legislation in both chambers of the state legislature and how these same factors affected, or did not affect, the incumbents that received cross-nominations in the 2010 elections. Overall, I find that party did not play a direct role in determining which legislators supported fusion, though female legislators were less supportive. When it came to obtaining nominations, the main finding is that incumbent candidates who voted yes to fusion were generally more likely to receive nominations. Still, legislators from the group that most opposed fusion, Democratic women, attempted to win cross-nominations once the 2010 elections approached. These findings suggest that candidate factors, more than party dictates, affected support for fusion and the ability of incumbents to receive cross-endorsements. Thus, the willingness of major-party candidates to adopt fusion can be understood through theories of candidate-centered elections and political parties.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: State politics; Third parties; Elections; Fusion; Oregon\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sheela S.

Yet nature-based solutions (NbS) are fundamental to the production of urban resilience. Focusing on Ghana's second largest city, Kumasi, this research (i) examines climate literacy and explores the existing nature-based solutions towards climate change adaption; (ii) examines the perception on existing NbS and the barriers to building climate resilience via NbS; and (iii) explores ways of promoting the implementation of NbS to build climate resilience. It addresses these objectives drawing from secondary data, 367 household surveys and 7 agency interviews. The findings show that about two thirds (63%) of urban residents in the case study area are climate illiterate, and this has affected the slow uptake of nature based solutions as climate management intervention. The urban residents acknowledge the importance of nature based solutions but identify barriers such as poor consideration of the role of natural infrastructure and their incorporation in the planning process, inadequate technical capacity and guidance for incorporating NbS in climate planning, high cost requirements of NbS interventions, disparate interests from various institutions, and a general lack of knowledge, appreciation and interest from urban residents. The study concludes that mainstreaming and upscaling NbS in urban systems will require major investments which should vary from one city to the other depending on perculiar needs.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Adaptation; Resilience; Climate change; Nature-based solutions; Kumasi; Ghana\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Rockli Kim, Sanjay K.

To date, studies have used single-level analyses with aggregated data either at the state level or, less commonly, at the region and district levels. This is the first comprehensive and empirical quantification of the relative importance of multiple geographic levels in shaping poverty distribution in India. We used multilevel logistic models to partition variation in poverty by levels of states, regions, districts, villages, and households. We also mapped the residuals at the state, region and district levels to visualize the geography of poverty. We used data on 35 states, 88 regions, 623 districts, 25,390 villages and 202,250 households from the National Sample Survey in years 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312. Our study found that geography of poverty in India cannot be fully explained by clustered distribution of poor households, and that there may be important contextual factors operating at the state and village levels. We found 13% of the variation in poverty to be attributable to states, 12% to villages, 4% to districts and 3% to regions, after accounting for important household characteristics. Similar variance partitioning was observed for rural and urban sample. The relative importance of one contextual level was highly sensitive to other levels simultaneously considered in the model. Findings from this study suggest that further explorations using multilevel modeling are warranted to identify specific contextual determinants of poverty at the state and village levels to reduce poverty and promote balanced regional development in India.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Asia; India; multilevel; poverty; geography; mapping\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n',b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n',b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n',b'Volume 33,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'100626,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Ferguson deemed that the establishment of separate school systems for whites and blacks did not violate the absolute equality of the two races before the law. Thus, the doctrine of separate but equal prevailed in the provision of public elementary, secondary, and tertiary education in southern states until 13 parents brought a class-action suit against the segregated Topeka, Kansas school district. The landmark decision Brown v. Topeka Board of Education (1954) ruled separate but equal unconstitutional in the case of education, outlawing de jure segregation. Yet, it took a number of years and additional court cases to compel districts to integrate schools and actually dismantle the dual system. Recent Supreme Court decisions do raise the possibility of resegregation going forward, as they narrow the circumstances in which race can be considered in enrolment decisions. In combination with the increasing popularity of various forms of school choice, the changing legal environment will likely erode some of the desegregation gains achieved over the past half century. This article attempts to summarize what we know about the impact of Brown on academic and economic outcomes for blacks. The first section briefly describes the legal history that established the environment governing the allocation of students among schools and the main types of plans used to desegregate schools. The next section documents changes over time in school-enrolment patterns, focusing both on the ways in which districts allocate students among schools and the distribution of students among districts. The penultimate section discusses evidence of desegregation-program effects on white enrolment and the final section discusses the evidence of the effects of school desegregation and racial composition on academic and economic outcomes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Education policy; Peer-racial-composition effects; School desegregation; School quality; Treatment effects; White flight\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Sicheng Wang, Yanfeng Xu,\\r\\n',b'Transit use for single-parent households: Evidence from Maryland,\\r\\n',b'Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives,\\r\\n',b'Volume 8,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'100223,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2590-1982,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trip.2020.100223.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301342)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Single parents face unique transportation barriers in their lives. Although helping single parents obtain private vehicles (e.g., car donation programs) would be a potential solution, we cannot ignore the high expense of maintaining and operating a vehicle, which may impose a heavy financial burden on single-parent families and constrain their ability to access opportunities and services. In contrast, public transit could be a more accessible and affordable transportation mode that benefits single-parent families. This study examined the association between public transit use and single parents using 2017 National Household Travel Survey and American Community Survey data for Maryland, United States. Using zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression, we found that single parents used transit more than the average resident, and census block groups with more single-parent families had more transit commuters, holding other demographic and socioeconomic variables constant. This association was more significant in large metropolitan and urban areas than the state average. The findings highlight the vital role of public transit in single parents' daily travel. We discussed policy implications related to helping single parents access opportunities and services.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Single parents; Transit; Transportation equity; Transportation barriers\\r\\n',b'C.P.

More recent concerns have stressed the effective nutritional utilization of that food by individuals, the sustainability of the food systems that produce the food, and the stability of both availability and access, often reflected in the volatility of food prices. Efforts to improve the level of food security are usually measured at the individual or household levels, but important policy issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and political concerns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are also raised at the national level. At a global level, considerable concern exists over the outcome of the race between increases in food supplies and in food demand.

Kunshan, a county in the dynamically growing Yangtze River Delta, serves as a case study to demonstrate how its villages progress in the path of urbanization with the tension between community endeavors managed by the collective and individual pursuits based on bottom-up initiatives. Community-initiated development tends to be socially inclusive to the locals, and there is observed spatial equality between village communities because of equal access to local opportunities. Mutual support within the community or collectivity built upon attachment and affiliation is crucial social capital binding the community together when it undertakes drastic social and economic changes. During the process of rural development, villages try to maintain their collectivity from collective agriculture to collective industrialization and further to collective land shareholding cooperatives in the context of progressive urbanization. Rural villagers are gradually becoming urbanites while remained connected to the village community services.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Collective community; Rural industrialization; Transition; China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Bego\\xc3\\xb1a Guti\\xc3\\xa9rrez-Nieto, Carlos Serrano-Cinca,\\r\\n',b'20 years of research in microfinance: An information management approach,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Information Management,\\r\\n',b'Volume 47,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 183-197,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0268-4012,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.01.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026840121830608X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In the last 20 years, microfinance has moved from a promise to reality, although with ups and downs.

Data analysis shows the two research traditions: papers focusing on clients (welfarists) and papers focusing on microfinance entities themselves (institutionalists). Institutionalism, which had little presence in the early research in microfinance, now exhibits great strength. A chronological analysis reveals the evolution of the topics most interesting to researchers: the first stage described the innovations of the microcredit practices and their impact; the second and very expansive stage in which microfinance institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 peculiarities were analyzed; and nowadays the sector is mature but with negative aspects arising, such as mission drift.

Low-income countries face severe human resource shortages, as training programs are underdeveloped. Health workforce issues include urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural differentiation, the promotion of standards and quality of care, specialization versus primary care, tensions between public and private health systems, and the integration of new health professions. The migration of health professionals from low- to high-income countries hampers the buildup of a critical mass of leaders, providers, and teachers to expand the capacity of health systems.

In Delhi, villages have been engulfed in the process of urbanisation and rural villages are transformed into urban villages. With the rapid expansion, there has been a significant increase in the number of urban villages. These urban villages are characterized by high growth rate, high density, over population, unplanned buildings and infrastructure shortage. This paper is an outcome of the doctoral research in this topic. The research examines the extent of physical growth and its impact on the increasing disaster risk in the urban villages of Delhi for both plot level and area level. Also it identifies the parameters that were significant contributors to the risk.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Dynamics; Disaster risk; Urban villages; Physical growth\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xiaobo Zhang, Shahidur Rashid, Kaikaus Ahmad, Akhter Ahmed,\\r\\n',b'Escalation of Real Wages in Bangladesh: Is it the Beginning of Structural Transformation?,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 64,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 273-285,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.06.015.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X14001740)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Using data from multiple sources, we show that the real wages in Bangladesh, particularly in rural areas and for female workers, have accelerated in recent years.

From a perspective of environmental equity, we focus on the distribution of four segments of the population\\xe2\\x80\\x94children, seniors, low-income individuals and visible minorities\\xe2\\x80\\x94in noise disturbance zones near major traffic routes of the Montreal Metropolitan Community. First, some corridors along these traffic routes with different levels of noise disturbance are defined according to a number of parameters; subsequently, the overrepresentation of the groups studied is assessed with the help of two indices. Next, we attempt to determine whether these groups have access to noise barriers, abatement measures to mitigate the noise. To assess the overrepresentation of the four groups under examination in protected and unprotected noise disturbance zones, multinomial logistic regression models were constructed for the entire territory, and then for six subregions. The results reveal a situation doubly inequitable for low-income persons and, to a lesser extent, for visible minorities. Indeed, these groups more often live close to major traffic routes and are less likely to be protected by noise barriers. In contrast, children are doubly advantaged.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Bob Rijkers, Rita Costa,\\r\\n',b'Gender and Rural Non-Farm Entrepreneurship,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 40, Issue 12,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 2411-2426,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2012.05.017.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001398)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Using matched household-enterprise-community datasets from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka, this paper analyzes gender differences in rural non-farm entrepreneurship.

Our findings clearly indicate that growth with redistribution (lower income inequality) was the key to reducing poverty continuously and in an important manner during 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932006. However, after 2006, decreasing per-capita income, coupled with the persistently high inequality (Gini of 52%), caused the reversal of the favorable trend observed since 1996, raising poverty to pre-2002 levels. Consequently, it is argued that, for Mexico, a middle-income country exhibiting quite low growth rates and high inequality levels, the further improvement in its distribution of income and assets is essential if the economy is to succeed in making a real dent in poverty. For that purpose, the implementation of an active pro-poor growth policy should be strongly encouraged.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: poverty; inequality; redistribution; pro-poor growth; Mexico; Latin America\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Alessandro Galli, Sara Moreno Pires, Katsunori Iha, Armando Abrunhosa Alves, David Lin, Maria Serena Mancini, Filipe Teles,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable food transition in Portugal: Assessing the Footprint of dietary choices and gaps in national and local food policies,\\r\\n',b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n',b'Volume 749,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'141307,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141307.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720348361)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: The food system is increasingly acknowledged as the single largest reason for humans' transgression of key planetary limits and it is gaining centrality in our societal run-up towards a sustainable future, especially at city level. In Portugal, a country characterized by high meat and fish consumption, noticeable food wastage, and high urbanization level, fully understanding and then transforming the food system is of priority. Here we investigate the significance of food in comparison to other daily anthropogenic demands and the current sourcing and resource intensities profiles of dietary patterns at Portuguese national and city level through Ecological Footprint Accounting. A critical assessment of gaps in national and local food policies to trigger a major transformation in the Portuguese food system is also conducted on the basis of a newly proposed analytical framework. Results show that food consumption in Portugal is the single largest reason (\\xe2\\x89\\x8830%) for transgressing the carrying capacity of Earth ecosystems but, despite the urgent need for changes in Portuguese food systems, major deficiencies in local policy implementation exist with weak policy commitment, coordination, and lacking institutional capacity as food policies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially at the local level \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are still not prioritized.

More recent concerns have stressed the effective nutritional utilization of that food by individuals, the sustainability of the food systems that produce the food, and the stability of both availability and access, often reflected in the volatility of food prices. Efforts to improve the level of food security are usually measured at the individual or household levels, but important policy issues \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and political concerns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are also raised at the national level. At a global level, considerable concern exists over the outcome of the race between increases in food supplies and in food demand.

In this paper, we argue that it is both productive and necessary to examine how climate justice is being pursued at the urban scale, which brings into focus the need for attention to issues of recognition as well as rights and responsibilities. Building on work from environmental justice, which has conceptualized justice as trivalent, we propose that climate justice can be understood as a pyramid, the faces of which are distributions, procedures, rights, responsibilities and recognition. We then apply this conceptual framework to examine climate change interventions in five cities; Bangalore, Monterrey, Hong Kong, Philadelphia and Berlin. Arguing that the politics and practices of urban climate change interventions are constantly engaging with and refracting the idea of justice, we examine how justice was articulated, practiced and contested across our cases. The perspective of recognition emerges as a particularly useful entry point through which to explore the types of rights, responsibilities, distributions and procedures required to respond justly to climate change. We conclude by reflecting on our framework, arguing that it is useful both as an analytical device to interrogate climate justice and to shape the design of climate change interventions which seek to ensure climate justice.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate justice; Climate change; Urban politics; Cities; Justice\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter W.

This rate is higher than in an economy without these externalities. Since measures of private non-market and social benefit externalities are positive, externalities contribute to higher per capita development. The total return is estimated to be considerably higher than the opportunity cost of funds and the return on physical capital, the first major evidence of serious underinvestment in higher education in the US for optimal development.

The chosen methodology credibly controls for the endogeneity of school resources and the results show a persistent positive gap between test scores of urban and rural students. The results of the Oaxaca\\xe2\\x80\\x93Blinder decomposition indicate that the better performance of larger settlements can be primarily explained by the differences in the socio-economic backgrounds of students. The regressions and the decomposition analysis indicate that an increase in school resources has no or only marginally positive impact on individual educational performance. Considering Russia's general demographic decline and the increasingly smaller number of school-aged children, which reduced school and class sizes, particularly in rural settlements, we point out severe inefficiencies plaguing the secondary education system in Russia. Our results also have rather general implications for the analysis of educational policies, which should take into account the evolving characteristics of the population they target.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Education quality; Russia; Urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural divide\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Elia Apostolopoulou, Hitesh Pant,\\r\\n',b'\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilk Road here we come\\xe2\\x80\\x9d: Infrastructural myths, post-disaster politics, and the shifting urban geographies of Nepal,\\r\\n',b'Political Geography,\\r\\n',b'Volume 98,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'102704,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0962-6298,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2022.102704.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629822001184)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: In this paper, we explain how China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) drives urban transformation in Nepal reconfiguring geopolitical and geoeconomic relations and remaking the sociopolitical, cultural and material fabric of hitherto peripheral spaces. Given that BRI infrastructures materialize in parallel with Chinese-funded reconstruction projects, we pay attention to the role of post-disaster politics to unravel how ongoing urban transformation does not only affect the present and the future but also people's histories and post-disaster memories by treating places of (re)building as empty of previous life and history. By drawing on 16 months of fieldwork, we show that despite the evident role of the BRI as an agent of urban transformation, the materialization of most BRI projects depends on geopolitical rivalries, negotiations, unstable local coalitions and escalating social contestation. We conclude that in the post-disaster era, BRI projects have become new vehicles towards Naya [new] Nepal, along with many other infrastructural myths that preceded the country's modern history. Nonetheless, the Naya urban Nepal that is emerging from the ruins of the past is contested and uncertain, a far cry from the days of the Panchayat regime and the civil war, when such gargantuan projects were rarely challenged by Nepali people. This is the unique trajectory of Silk Road urbanization in Nepal: an ultimate path to reach a long due rural-to-urban transition that is inextricably linked with decades of infrastructural violence and precarity and strongly shaped by people's struggles against the unequal geographies of BRI-driven urban transformation.\\r\\n\",b'\\n',b'Nauman Ejaz, Thilak Mallawaarachchi,\\r\\n',b'Disparities in economic achievement across the rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban divide in Pakistan: Implications for development planning,\\r\\n',b'Economic Analysis and Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 77,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'Pages 487-512,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0313-5926,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2022.11.023.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0313592622002077)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Growth, underpinned by augmented production, has been the dominant mode of development, where the focus is to influence the ability to increase the output and income of producers. In this process, differences in economic achievement are influenced collectively by geography, culture and institutions that determine effective capabilities. Yet, disparities associated with place are still widespread. In this paper, we draw some insights on the nature of economic deprivation amongst Pakistan households using Household Integrated Economic Survey (PSLM/HIES) data and treating the residential location as a key parameter of interest. In relating to the well-known discussion on rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban divide, we identify some commonalities in location-specific attributes in the achievement of economic-wellbeing. The analyses confirm the existing knowledge that poverty and well-being have strong place attachments, favouring urban areas as locations of greater relative well-being due to low levels of deprivation, in particular health, education and food security. In discussing how location may predispose inhabitants to deprivations or vulnerabilities, we identify some opportunities to realign development focus towards meeting local needs and raising aspirations for self-empowerment by better focusing on the nature of economic linkages that supports livelihood diversity.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Income inequality; Rural transformation; Assets; Wealth; Economic participation; Pakistan\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Raymundo M.

In addition to the perceived level of inequality typically measured in previous studies, we explore perceptions about who is rich and poor and their share of the population. The shape of perceived inequality that we find provides new insights as to why people tolerate large differences between the rich and the poor. We find that Mexicans generally perceive poverty and inequality not too far from measured levels, but they overestimate the income of the rich and their proportion of the population. Their perceptions of social mobility correctly estimate persistence rates at the top and bottom of the distribution, but they overestimate upward and downward mobility. Providing people with more information about observed income inequality and social mobility could be one way to encourage a demand for redistribution. However, randomly providing selected participants with this information has almost zero effect on their desired levels of equality, social mobility, and tax rates. Finally, we find that Mexicans want a progressive tax system in which the poor pay an average tax rate of 14% and the wealthy pay 41%, and that preference for a more progressive tax structure is negatively related to socioeconomic status.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Inequality; Social mobility; Perceptions; Mexico\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mehmet Kalayc\\xc4\\xb1o\\xc4\\x9flu, Sibel Kalayc\\xc4\\xb1o\\xc4\\x9flu, Kezban \\xc3\\x87elik, Ryerson Christie, Maria Evangelina Filippi,\\r\\n',b'An analysis of social vulnerability in a multi-hazard urban context for improving disaster risk reduction policies: The case of Sancaktepe, \\xc4\\xb0stanbul,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,\\r\\n',b'Volume 91,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'103679,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2212-4209,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.103679.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420923001590)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Despite concerted calls over the past 20 years to ensure that urban development is undertaken in a manner that reduces disaster risk, urban planning often remains myopically focused on the built environment, seeing building codes, and land-use planning, as the most effective mechanisms of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR). While these are clearly crucial elements of planning for Tomorrow's Cities, they are only a part of an effective strategy. This article makes the fundamental assertion that DRR policies addressing urban spaces must strive to redress drivers of social vulnerability. This requires an understanding of the complex interactions of forms of marginalization within the local contexts, and how these have been shaped by the broader urban planning and DRR planning environment. A qualitative research method is employed in this study to assist the development of Tomorrow's Cities Decision Support Environment (TCDSE) that facilitates co-production for risk-informed decision-making on future pro-poor urban development in the context of natural hazards. The research study involved semi-structured interviews to obtain an in-depth account of social vulnerability in Sancaktepe, \\xc4\\xb0stanbul. The narratives of the people draw upon different socio-demographic, and socio-economic vulnerabilities besides vulnerabilities due to urban renewal processes which underestimate pro-poor policies in \\xc4\\xb0stanbul. Drawing on the narratives of interviewees, we then highlight the added value of contextualized and (inter)subjective qualitative interpretations. In conclusion, we argue how disaster risk-informed decision-making processes can be more progressive to ensure and serve in reducing vulnerabilities through our qualitative understanding as a voice of the community.

The aim of this study is to measure spatial equity based on spatial proportionalities (SESP), taking into account three-fold factors including service availability, accessibility and mobility. The SESP identifies proportionality between the quality of service distribution and allocating opportunities and the quality of getting access to locations and people's selections according to status quo. Thus, it examines the balance between supply and demand, optimization of distance and the number of choices people make out of total services and the role of move ability to use in compensating for shortages either in terms of service capacity or the level of human deprivation and reduction of effects of distance from services and etc. Gorgan as an old and intermediate city in northern Iran was selected as the case study. The results indicated that the study area does not enjoy suitable proportionality, revealing that the central and northern districts have much more enjoyment than the southern, eastern and western districts. Thus, there is disproportionality between supply and demand, high difference in provided choices and disproportionality between less enjoyed areas and their move ability to use services and inability to create walking travel pattern in Gorgan. Understanding of spatial proportionality can help the planners and policy makers to change their passive role into active in order to reduce inequities, adding to their knowledge on the underlying factors of inequity as well as the factors that hinder and reverse the cycle of inequity.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Spatial proportionality; Spatial equity; Accessibility; Availability; Mobility; SESP method\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Deepty Jain, Geetam Tiwari,\\r\\n',b'Explaining travel behaviour with limited socio-economic data: Case study of Vishakhapatnam, India,\\r\\n',b'Travel Behaviour and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 15,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 44-53,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2214-367X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2018.12.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X18300668)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Travel behaviour varies with respect to the income. Directly reported incomes used in the travel behaviour studies are subject to the issues of under and non-reporting. To account for this, we propose principal component analysis (PCA) on household asset ownership data to estimate socio-economic wellbeing score (SEWS) as the proxy of income. SEWS is used to understand the variation in travel behaviour of people belonging to different income groups in Vishakhapatnam. We have used sample data of 2623 households collected in 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x932013. Internal coherency test and chi-square tests are conducted to assess the robustness of estimated SEWS. Travel behaviour analysis highlights that both the trip length and mode choice significantly varies with regard to the SEWS in Vishakhapatnam. People belonging to the low and low middle SEWS group are more dependent on walking and travel shorter distances as compared to the middle high and very high SEWS group. Encouraging the middle high and very high SEWS group to travel short distances and use low carbon modes of transport will need interventions related to the development control regulations and infrastructure provision. Since SEWS is estimated using multiple variables and captures the consumption pattern of the households, therefore, it can be used as the proxy of income in travel behaviour studies.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Principal component analysis; Asset ownership; Socio-economic wellbeing; Trip length; Modal share\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Gilberto Mahumane, Peter Mulder,\\r\\n',b'Urbanization of energy poverty?

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Luis A.

Rising interest on inclusive development of cities at different levels of urban policy involves new opportunities and challenges for increasingly urban societies. In cities of the Global South, in addition to institutional and physical challenges for the development of efficient and inclusive public transport, local governments face the challenge of making public transport affordable for a large share of the population in conditions of poverty. In order to meet these challenges, several public transport systems throughout have implemented targeted subsidies for specific social groups such as students, the elderly and people with reduced mobility, and more recently for the poor. The government of Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 has implemented a pro-poor public transport subsidy scheme that aims at alleviating the financial burden of poor households for accessing the city's public transport system. This research develops an analysis of the effects of such subsidy from an accessibility perspective using potential accessibility measures to employment opportunities and assess its impact on equity. The research builds on the hypothesis that accessibility is a multi-dimensional construct that can benefit from the decrease in economic as much as gains in time costs. Results from the analysis show that both the current structure of the pro-poor subsidies in Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 and alternative scenarios for increasing its coverage are progressive, improving accessibility and equity for those with access to the subsidy. The paper provides valuable insights for the analysis of similar policies in other urban contexts in the Global South.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Public transport; Transport subsidies; Job-accessibility; Equity; Palma ratio; Gini index; Bogot\\xc3\\xa1\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Andrew Dustan, Diana K.L.

In contrast, we find little effect on the choices or assignments of low-achievers or those with lower-education parents.

Empirical findings support, although not very strongly, the institutionalist view, i.e., pro-worker amendment in labour laws induces employment. Among the other factors, real wage rate has significant negative effect on employment, whereas that for real per capita developmental capital expenditure, per capita electricity generation capacity and real per capita net state domestic product is significant positive. However, effect of per capita real developmental revenue expenditure is inconclusive. In other words, although it improves employability of workers through their human capital improvement, which is probably met up at the cost of worsening overall infrastructural development, through reducing corresponding capital expenditure!

Additionally, we describe strong country-level heterogeneity in the spatial dynamics of personal support networks and find national contexts to be moderating the effect of education on community liberation, especially in Italy and Hungary, thus suggesting network geographic dispersion to be linked to national economic structures and labor markets. The paper thus elucidates the effect of two different, yet related social contexts on personal networks: the class context and the national context.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Personal networks; Social support; Community liberated; Context; Inequality; Education\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'R.D.

Most notably, between 2005 and 2013, one-year intercity migration rate for immigrants has decreased by 0.7 percentage-points, compared to a 0.2 percentage-point decline for the U.S.-born population. Literature on urban implications of geographic mobility suggests that consideration of migration trends, or population flows, can improve urban planning, including transportation. Our research focuses on recent immigrants, a group that significantly contributes to public transit ridership in the U.S. In this study, we analyze the influence of the annual average in-migration rate of recent immigrants to various urban areas from within the country on transit ridership changes across the urban areas between 2008 and 2013. We also compare this effect with the effect of annual average in-migration rate of new immigrants to various urban areas from foreign countries. While the average effect of inflow of new foreign migrants on transit demand is suggested in the literature, distinguishing the transit demand of immigrants that are not movers and those that are movers from various locations remains unexplored. We derive migration flows from the American Community Survey microdata, and transit ridership from the U.S. National Transit Database. We perform geospatial analysis to overcome several constraints that make exploration of the migration-transportation connection difficult, particularly the lack of uniformity in geographic boundaries used for data presentation across and within government agencies, and over time. Our results indicate that consideration of domestic in-migration rates of recent immigrants can improve transit demand forecasting. As past literature has found, recent immigrants are highly likely to use transit. Recent immigrant migrants that have arrived directly from another country are even more likely to use transit. Interestingly, recent immigrants that move to a metropolitan area from another location in the U.S. are relatively less likely to use transit. Among domestic migrants, however, those that move to cities undergoing large increase in transit service relative to population are more likely to use transit. High population and transit stop density of both previous and current cities seem to positively affect transit mode choice for commute trips of recent immigrant movers. Declining inter-urban mobility among recent immigrants can indeed alter future transit demand trends. Transit agencies should not treat recent immigrants as a monolithic group. Consideration of the migration patterns of various types of recent immigrants, and factors that determine those patterns, can improve demand forecasting and planning.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Immigrants; Travel demand; Travel behavior; Public transit\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shahidur R.

This approach is applied to cross-sectional data from a comprehensive 2005 household survey representative of both urban and rural India. The objective is to determine if the energy poor are also income poor and whether and how energy policies help reduce energy poverty, independent of income. The findings suggest that in rural areas some 57% of households are energy poor, versus 22% that are income poor. But in urban areas the energy poverty rate is 28% compared to 20% that are income poor. That is, energy policies are expected to play some roles in mitigating energy poverty. We find that reducing energy poverty requires not only support for rural electrification, but also more use of modern cooking fuels such as LPG. While income growth matters, a combination of energy related programs can play an independent and substantial role in reducing energy poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Income poverty; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Vikram Patel, Shekhar Saxena, Crick Lund, Graham Thornicroft, Florence Baingana, Paul Bolton, Dan Chisholm, Pamela Y Collins, Janice L Cooper, Julian Eaton, Helen Herrman, Mohammad M Herzallah, Yueqin Huang, Mark J D Jordans, Arthur Kleinman, Maria Elena Medina-Mora, Ellen Morgan, Unaiza Niaz, Olayinka Omigbodun, Martin Prince, Atif Rahman, Benedetto Saraceno, Bidyut K Sarkar, Mary De Silva, Ilina Singh, Dan J Stein, Charlene Sunkel, J\\xc3\\x9crgen Un\\xc3\\x9ctzer,\\r\\n',b'The Lancet Commission on global mental health and sustainable development,\\r\\n',b'The Lancet,\\r\\n',b'Volume 392, Issue 10157,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1553-1598,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0140-6736,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31612-X.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361831612X)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Marijke Verpoorten, Abhimanyu Arora, Nik Stoop, Johan Swinnen,\\r\\n',b'Self-reported food insecurity in Africa during the food price crisis,\\r\\n',b'Food Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 39,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 51-63,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0306-9192,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.12.006.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919212001315)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article analyzes data on self-reported food insecurity of more than 50,000 individuals in 18 Sub-Saharan African countries over the period 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x932008, when global food prices increased dramatically. The average level of self-reported food insecurity was high but remarkably stable over time, at about 54%. However, this average hides large heterogeneity, both within countries and across countries. In eight of the sample countries, self-reported food security improved, while it worsened in the ten other countries. Our results suggest that heterogeneous effects in self-reported food security are consistent with economic predictions, as they are correlated with economic growth and net food consumption (both at the household and country level). Specifically, in the face of rising food prices, self-reported food security improved on average in rural households, while it worsened in urban households \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a finding that holds when using global prices or domestic food prices. Improvements in food security over time were also positively correlated with net food exports and GDP per capita growth.

It is argued that Mexico City's land-use policy has been reactive and internally inconsistent, failing to take informal settlements into account, has not offered the poor access to housing with adequate services and greater security in terms of land tenure, and lacks the necessary financial resources and institutional capabilities for providing solutions to these problems. Through a case study of informal settlement management policy in the Tlalpan Delegation,11The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelegation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refers to a subdistrict or municipality within the Federal District (D.F.).

Better developmental and health outcomes are strongly associated with family assets, income and education. We introduce a model incorporating a range of theoretical and empirical literature about the relationships between a household's socio-economic position, household interactions, and child educational outcomes. The intention is to illustrate how these frequently cited factors are exacerbated and aligned by stress or difficult environments which cause long-term challenges for children in high-risk circumstances. Finally, we modify the model to illustrate the dynamic nature of these relationships, highlighting how the developmental trajectory of a child who lives with toxic stress might differ from a comparable child with social supports in a situation of low or tolerable stress.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Assets; Children; Education; Risk; Toxic Stress\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Khalid Zaman, Bashir Ahmad Khilji,\\r\\n',b'RETRACTED: The relationship between growth\\xe2\\x80\\x93inequality\\xe2\\x80\\x93poverty triangle and pro-poor growth policies in Pakistan: The twin disappointments,\\r\\n',b'Economic Modelling,\\r\\n',b'Volume 30,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 375-393,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-9993,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econmod.2012.09.023.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264999312002982)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy).

Today these concerns are particularly relevant to Africa, with its rapid population growth, very small farms, and chronic food insecurity. In this paper we examine adaptation to falling land-labor ratios using a comprehensive theoretical framework in which households faced with binding land constraints can respond in three ways: intensifying agricultural production, diversifying out of agriculture, and reducing fertility rates. Using cross-country data and drawing upon the existing literature, we reach three conclusions. First, population density is associated with reduced fallows and more intensive use of land but not fertilizer use or irrigation, indicating major challenges in achieving sustainable intensification or agricultural productivity growth. Second, there is little evidence of successful non-farm diversification in response to land pressures in Africa from domestic or international income sources. Third, rural Africans in land constrained countries desire smaller families, but have thus far benefited little from family planning policies. These findings underscore the need for a coordinated multi-sectoral approach to sustainably reduce poverty in the region.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Population density; Land constraints; Agricultural intensification; Fertility rates; Rural nonfarm economy; Migration\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Raili Nugin,\\r\\n',b\"\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think that they should go.

By looking at media and in-depth interviews with rural youth workers, narratives surrounding young people are examined. These narratives enable rural youth to ground their choices of migration. Rurality is constructed in media through two powerful templates: one of structural marginalization and the other of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpastoral idyll\\xe2\\x80\\x9d based on the stereotypes of nation construction. Youth migration is often explained in media as self-realisation or inevitable moves. Rural youth workers are concerned about young people leaving their home areas, but at the same time they rationalise their leaving by contemporary narratives of self-empowerment and self-expression. Thus, leaving is depicted as moving \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9caway\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In addition, the constantly changing rural context in post-socialist Estonia contributes to a notion of non-fixity in life course decisions and the perception that it is always possible to come back.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Rural youth; Out-migration; Youth transitions; Media discourses; Marginalisation\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mylene Lagarde, Duane Blaauw,\\r\\n',b'Pro-social preferences and self-selection into jobs: Evidence from South African nurses,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization,\\r\\n',b'Volume 107, Part A,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 136-152,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0167-2681,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2014.09.004.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268114002340)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Although a growing body of economic work has looked at the role of pro-social motives to explain self-selection into public or not-for-profit sector jobs, in particular in the delivery of social services, no attention has been given to the role of pro-social preferences in the decision to take up posts in rural and isolated areas. Yet there are reasons to believe that such choices involve a degree of self-sacrifice, in particular in developing countries where rural regions typically combine geographic hostile environment, high levels of poverty, low educational opportunities, limited access to basic services and worse career opportunities. On the other hand, as shortage of qualified staff is higher in rural areas, the returns on the presence of a health worker, and the benefits to the populations, are likely to be higher. Using data from a longitudinal study of nurses in South Africa this paper tests this hypothesis by linking experimental measure of pro-social preferences and revealed preferences outcomes. Three measures of pro-social preferences are constructed based on donations made by study participants in a dictator game played at baseline. Job choices are observed three years later for more than 97% of the initial sample. We show that the more dedicated the nurses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 measured by their generosity towards patients in the dictator game \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the more likely they are to have chosen a rural job. This result is robust to the inclusion of various demographic controls and to different econometric specifications. This finding contributes to the literature on role of pro-social values as an intrinsic motivation factor in labour supply decisions and it has policy implications for the provision of social services in difficult settings.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Public services; Pro-social motives; Self-selection; Rural areas; Nurses; South Africa\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Qiyan Wu, Jianquan Cheng, Guo Chen, Daniel J.

Analyses of diverse data sets at varied spatial scales have supported the development of theoretical frameworks. However, the majority of Chinese case studies published in recent decades were dominantly based on either non-spatial data or population census data at sub-district (or jiedao in Chinese) level. These analyses have been limited through using low-resolution aggregate data resulting in incomplete or biased findings. This paper aims to examine the fine-scale socio-spatial structure of the inner city of Nanjing using the fifth population census data of 2000 at the lowest spatial scale \\xe2\\x80\\x93 community (or juweihui in Chinese) level. Our findings reveal that the policies of the socialist era and the initial outcomes of the introduction of a free market, particularly with regard to the creation of new elite spaces within the inner city, have shaped a complex pattern of socio-spatial differentiation and residential segregation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Socio-spatial differentiation; Residential segregation; Principal component analysis; Community-level; Nanjing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Matamyo Simwanda, Yuji Murayama,\\r\\n',b'Spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use change in the rapidly growing city of Lusaka, Zambia: Implications for sustainable urban development,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Cities and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 39,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 262-274,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2210-6707,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2018.01.039.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670717309186)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This study examines the spatiotemporal patterns of urban land use (urban-LU) change in the rapidly urbanising city of Lusaka, Zambia, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using geospatial tools and techniques. The results show that the city experienced rapid urban growth, with about a 233% increase in the total urban-LU area from 1990 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 2010. The results also show that urban-LU expansion was more intense during the 2000s than during the 1990s. Spatially, the city displays a disordered pattern of urban-LU associated with the pattern of major roads and the city centre, which draws its legacies from the colonial era. Lusaka has emerged as a highly unplanned city with approximately 40% of the city representing unplanned residential land use dominated by informal settlements (30%). The growth of commercial and industrial land use has also been consistent with high density residential land uses. The growth of planned residential, and public institutions and service land uses has been slow. The results further reveal spatial dependency of informal settlements on commercial and industrial, and planned medium to high density residential land uses. The study discusses and offers vital insights for strategic urban planning that can control the observed unplanned urban growth and stimulate sustainable urban development.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban land use; Unplanned urban development; Intensity and gradient analysis; Spatial dependency modeling; GIS; Lusaka City\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'J.M.

But concepts of yield gaps vary and the linkages to food security are complex. Yields are an object of choice for farmers, so a meaningful interpretation of yield gaps requires giving weight to both the economic and biological realities of crop production. We clarify the terminology surrounding yield gaps, show that closing yield gaps is not necessarily economic, and conclude that food security will be better served by policies that directly enhance the productive capacity of agriculture to supply affordable food efficiently and sustainably.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Crop productivity; Economic efficiency; Food security; Maize; Maximum limiting yield; Measuring yield; Partial factor productivity; Potential yield; Production possibilities; Technical efficiency; Technology; Yield; Yield gap; Yield limit\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jo\\xc3\\xa3o M.

This paper seeks to open up the various fuel-supply strategies that underpin domestic energy use in low-income settings to explain the unconventional solutions (jugaad) that households employ to bridge the gap between energy needs and supply of various fuels, including liquefied petroleum gas. We draw on long-term ethnographic engagements in four severely polluted low-income urban settlements in central India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coal belt to investigate how communities, and primarily women, ensure domestic energy provision. As households struggle to secure a range of potential fuels with different benefits and drawbacks, we outline the socio-cultural and economic processes that shape household energy decision-making. These highly uncertain processes take place within an institutional structure that offers some possibilities, but is overall too rigid to fit the lived realties of low-income residents. Although households commonly understand that there are negative health effects from solid-fuel smoke, pollution and health are only marginal considerations for households facing daily struggles to reduce expenses. We argue that understanding the everyday jugaad of household energy provision is crucial for the possibilities to shift away from fuels damaging to both human health and the environment.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Feminist political ecology; Air pollution; Household fuel; Jugaad; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'C.

On the contrary, less is known about the link between city size and material living conditions. Recently, a strong emphasis has been put on the process of urbanization without growth and on the burst of large cities. The creation of slums and large areas with underdeveloped housing characteristics has become a major concern for urban planners. This is especially the case for developing economies. This work analyses the association between city size and material living conditions in Ecuador, a small developing country experiencing rapid urbanization and where slums constitute a relevant part of the urban landscape. Our findings show that living in denser areas is associated with lower levels of deprivation and overcrowding. Nonetheless, we also show evidence of congestion in larger cities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Deprivation; Developing economies; Ecuador; Slums\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jessica Lin,\\r\\n',b'Affordability and access in focus: Metrics and tools of relative energy vulnerability,\\r\\n',b'The Electricity Journal,\\r\\n',b'Volume 31, Issue 6,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 23-32,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1040-6190,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tej.2018.06.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040619018301489)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This work will focus on the consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s household budget to better characterize the vulnerability of low-income communities and the metrics that would be most appropriate to measure the \\xe2\\x80\\x98affordability\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of energy.

Situation analysis of the GBM landscape gives an understanding about the potential prospects and emerging challenges of the region in the face of changing climate and environmental pollution that affects water regime and its quality. This chapter reveals the fact that strategic water management at local, national, and river basin scale can be the driving force to address the emerging challenges common to the region, particularly through river conservation, effective governance, and agreed regional policy to be implemented by the governments of the basin countries. The importance of effective regional cooperation through data sharing, confidence building, and water-sharing treaties in water management for multiple benefit sharing are highlighted toward achieving the peoples' welfare of the greater basin. The river systems are interdependent on one another, and hence, integrated and collaborative policies with investment in adaptive technologies are required for a sustainable solution. This chapter sets objectives to identify and appraise the issues, evaluates problems and prospects for common understanding, and sensitizes the policymakers of the GBM countries on managing water under uncertain climate risks so that water-centered sustainable development through an integrated approach is encouraged in new ways of multiple benefit sharing within the horizon of climate change.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Basin-wide regional cooperation; Climate change; Ganges\\xe2\\x80\\x93Brahmaputra\\xe2\\x80\\x93Meghna Basin; Integrated water management; Transboundary rivers\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'J.

Malnutrition does not always imply hunger or famine and is manifest in many forms, ranging from hunger to obesity. Core factors leading to malnutrition include excessive intakes, insufficient food consumption, and inadequate utilization of nutrients provided by foods ingested. Undernutrition is a term that comprises stunting, underweight, wasting, and deficiency in essential vitamins and minerals (also called micronutrients). As such, it is the category of malnutrition that represents nutrient deficits. The other form of malnutrition is associated with excessive energy and nutrient intakes (which may also be accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies or suboptimal intakes), leading to obesity and other diet-related noncommunicable diseases. This article focuses on undernutrition and the challenges countries face in dealing with both undernutrition and overnutrition, in essence, the dilemma of overlapping and coexisting forms of malnutrition.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Development; Malnutrition; Micronutrient deficiency; Severe acute malnutrition; Stunting; Sustainability; Undernourishment; Undernutrition; Wasting\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Masayoshi Okabe,\\r\\n',b'Gender-preferential intergenerational patterns in primary educational attainment: An econometric approach to a case in rural Mindanao, the Philippines,\\r\\n',b'International Journal of Educational Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 46,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 125-142,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0738-0593,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedudev.2015.10.006.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059315001285)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: This study investigates the factors determining children's educational attainment, focusing on gender-differential intergenerational patterns, by employing a case study from rural Mindanao. The result mainly shows, unlike general trends in developing countries, educational attainment is more favorable for girls; maternal education level is equally associated with daughters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and sons\\xe2\\x80\\x99 education levels, and paternal education level is preferentially favorable to their sons. To reduce the disparity, suggestions include providing boy-specific interventions to enhance the magnitude of the father\\xe2\\x80\\x93son educational virtuous circle and comparing the magnitude of gender-equal maternal and boy-preferential paternal education influences to specify which effect is larger.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Gender-preferential intergenerational patterns; Elementary education; Delays in schooling; Limited dependent variable regression; Rural Mindanao; The Philippines\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Theodore H.

This includes financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. Universal health coverage (UHC) means inclusion and empowerment for all people to access medical care, including treatment and prevention services. UHC exists in all the industrial nations except the US, which has a mixed public-private system and struggles with closing the gap between the insured and the uninsured population. Middle- and low-income countries face many challenges for UHC achievement, including low levels of funding, lack of personnel, weak health management, and issues of availability of services favoring middle- and upper-class communities. Community health services for preventive and curative health services for needs in populations at risk for poor health in low-income countries must be addressed with proactive health promotion initiatives for the double burden of infectious and noncommunicable diseases. Each nation will develop its own unique approach to national health systems, but there are models used by a number of countries based on principles of national responsibility for health, social solidarity for providing funding, and for effective ways of providing care with comprehensiveness, efficiency, quality, and cost containment. Universal access does not eliminate social inequalities in health by itself, including a wide context of reducing social inequities. Understanding national health systems requires examining representative models of different systems. Health reform is necessarily a continuing process as all countries must adapt to face challenges of cost constraints, inequalities in access to care, aging populations, emergence of new disease conditions and advancing technology including the growing capacity of medicine, public health and health promotion. The growing stress of increasing obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, requires nations to modify their health care systems. Learning from the systems developed in different countries helps to learn from the processes of change in other countries.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: National health insurance; national health systems; universal access; global health; health systems in upper; mid level and low income countries; Otto von Bismarck; Nikolai Semashko; William Beveridge; TC (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTommy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) Douglas; Lyndon Johnson; Barack Obama; cost constraint; inequalities; health promotion\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Zhihao Zheng, Shida Rastegari Henneberry,\\r\\n',b'Estimating the impacts of rising food prices on nutrient intake in urban China,\\r\\n',b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 23, Issue 4,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1090-1103,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2012.07.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X12000636)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The nutritional impacts of rising food prices on urban households across income classes are assessed using the 2004 NBS urban household survey data for Jiangsu province of China.

This paper explores how entrepreneurship in informal settlements contributes to the co-production of public services. The paper is based on social entrepreneurship frameworks (concerned with infrastructure, environment, housing and technology) that emerged from the literature review, focusing on strategies to solve challenges in informal settlements. The essence of the review was to ascertain the nature of existing and potential entrepreneurial initiatives and the implications for actors, communities, urban governance systems and research. The Campbell collaboration systematic literature review technique was adapted (in a scoping format) as a methodology to screen relevant studies by following the PRISMA Flow statement. The literature review process involved screening 2835 articles from 109 scientific journals published between 2014 and 2022. The outcome of the literature review indicated that current research in this area differed in focus, methodology, and application of theory. It concluded that research that focuses on the contribution of entrepreneurs to the co-production of public services in informal settlements is limited. Using the knowledge that emerged from the literature review, the current study produced an entrepreneurial framework for co-producing public services in informal settlements. It also provided an overview of theoretical and practical knowledge for further research. Future researchers can use the findings of this study to align their research within the interface between entrepreneurship and land management.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Entrepreneurship; Informal settlements; Land; Land governance; Land management; Scoping review\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Brennan Davis, Sonya Grier,\\r\\n',b'A tale of two urbanicities: Adolescent alcohol and cigarette consumption in high and low-poverty urban neighborhoods,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Business Research,\\r\\n',b'Volume 68, Issue 10,\\r\\n',b'2015,\\r\\n',b'Pages 2109-2116,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0148-2963,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.03.009.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014829631500123X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Urbanicity encompasses the different aspects of living in an urban area. While past research treats urban areas as homogeneous, this research employs an empirical study to show how intra-urban differences by poverty are associated with cigarette and alcohol consumption by adolescents. Results demonstrate that for higher poverty adolescents, those living in urban versus less urban areas consume significantly more alcohol and cigarettes. At the same time, for wealthier adolescents, those living in urban versus less urban areas consume significantly fewer of those items. The results are mediated by convenience store density, contributing to our understanding of the relationship between urban environments, specific area characteristics and problem consumption among adolescents. The results suggest that it might be useful to consider new ways of understanding problem consumption by studying distinct aspects of urbanicity related to the retail environment.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Adolescents; Poverty; Cigarette and alcohol consumption; Urbanicity\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Steven Poelhekke,\\r\\n',b'Urban growth and uninsured rural risk: Booming towns in bust times,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Development Economics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 96, Issue 2,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 461-475,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0304-3878,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2010.07.007.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304387810000866)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Rapid urbanization also happens when economic growth and urban job creation are absent, such as in Africa and Latin America during the eighties.

Slum rehabilitation in Mumbai is a hallmark example of a participatory process which is supposed to improve the quality of life and well-being among the rehabilitated occupants, on paper. Yet our findings show that the key stakeholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (i.e. policymaker, architect, management co-operatives and female occupants) sentiments are worlds apart. This gap evokes a need for a more systematic framework for a participatory approach. Verbal communication has the power to implicitly decipher the common emotion or sentiment regarding infrastructure or its related policy. This study uses a quasi-qualitative approach to understand the underlying concerns of gender mainstreaming in slum rehabilitation housing (SRH) management in Mumbai, India. Verbal narratives from semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions are used to explore the concerns of the stakeholders. Sentiment analysis using the machine learning technique of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to decode the emotions across the stakeholders. The results indicate that gender inequality in SRH is propagated through lack of communication and the different vocabulary used by the female occupants and the apex policymakers. There are also remarkable differences between male- and female-led co-operatives who are in charge of SRH management. Female-led co-operatives were observed to go beyond basic maintenance duties, to reduce debt and monthly fees and to take up incremental improvements such as decorative elements or installation of solar panels. This participation required a full female body co-operative rather than partial female representation in order to be effective. This study suggests that gender mainstreaming is important not only in SRH design but also in maintenance and that exploring the sentiments of the key stakeholders, as proposed in our analysis, could mitigate undesirable effects of SRH and enable the participatory process.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Participatory approach; Gender mainstreaming; Slum rehabilitation; Stakeholders perception; Semantic maps; Sentiment analysis\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Michael Herrmann,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable development, demography and sexual and reproductive health: inseparable linkages and their policy implications,\\r\\n',b'Reproductive Health Matters,\\r\\n',b'Volume 22, Issue 43,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 28-42,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0968-8080,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-8080(14)43757-1.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968808014437571)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The greatest challenge today is to meet the needs of current and future generations, of a large and growing world population, without imposing catastrophic pressures on the natural environment. Meeting this challenge depends on decisive policy changes in three areas: more inclusive economic growth, greener economic growth, and population policies. This article focuses on efforts to address and harness demographic changes for sustainable development, which are largely outside the purview of the current debate. Efforts to this end must be based on the recognition that demographic changes are the cumulative result of individual choices and opportunities, and that demographic changes are best addressed through policies that enlarge these choices and opportunities, with a focus on ensuring unrestricted and universal access to sexual and reproductive health information and services, empowering women to fully participate in social, economic and political life, and investing in the education of the younger generation beyond the primary level. The article provides a strong argument for why the Programme of Action that was agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) 20 years ago continues to hold important implications and lessons for the formulation of the post-2015 development agenda, which is expected to supersede the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\\r\\n',b'R\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9\\r\\n',b'Le principal enjeu aujourd\\xe2\\x80\\x99hui est de r\\xc3\\xa9pondre aux besoins des g\\xc3\\xa9n\\xc3\\xa9rations actuelles et futures, d\\xe2\\x80\\x99une population mondiale importante et qui s\\xe2\\x80\\x99accro\\xc3\\xaet, sans imposer de pressions catastrophiques sur l\\xe2\\x80\\x99environnement naturel.

By utilising qualitative research methods it highlights the contradictory nature of these meanings: young men are ambivalent toward education when discussing their experiences, yet optimistic when idealising education and imagining their futures. By interpreting these viewpoints through the theoretical framework of Pierre Bourdieu, I argue that these meanings reflect social, political and economic change in general and contradictions embedded in the education system in particular. While education has historically been used by the Indian middle classes to realise advantage and consolidate privilege, development discourses conceptualise it as a means of achieving social justice and realising equality. Struggles over the meaning education have important social implications for lower middle class young men: although they are excluded from education which they consider to be worthwhile, their discontent is mediated by hegemonic understandings of education. Highlighting these contradictory meanings can be seen as an important contribution to debates about education, development and the Indian middle classes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Education; Neoliberal development; Young men; Bourdieu; Dehradun; Lower middle classes\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kehinde Paul Adeosun, Mary Greene, Peter Oosterveer,\\r\\n',b'Urban daily lives and out-of-home food consumption among the urban poor in Nigeria: A practice-based approach,\\r\\n',b'Sustainable Production and Consumption,\\r\\n',b'Volume 32,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'Pages 479-491,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2352-5509,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2022.04.024.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352550922001129)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Understanding the interaction between urban daily lives and patterns of food consumption in the Global South is important for informing health and sustainability transitions. In recent years, the lives of poor urban dwellers have undergone significant transformations which have been associated with shifts in patterns of daily food consumption from household-based towards primarily out-of-home. However, as of yet, little research has explored how changing everyday contexts of consumers' lives interrelate with their food vending-consumption practices. This study seeks to understand the interrelations between everyday urban lives and out-of-home food consumption practices among the urban poor in Ibadan, Nigeria. A situated social practice approach is employed to understand how everyday contexts shape practices of out-of-home food vending consumption. Multiple methods were employed, including GIS mapping of food vending outlets, quantitative consumer surveys, in-depth consumer interviews, and participant observation. The study provides an overview of food vending-consumption practices in terms of the socio-demographic situation of consumers and the embeddedness of food vending in the practice arrangements making up their daily lives. The findings reveal three key daily life practices that interlock with their ready-to-eat foods consumption practices: daily mobility practices, working arrangements, and domestic engagements These three categories of daily urban practices that have undergone rapid transformation in line with socio-economic change and urbanisation and emerged as particularly important in shaping out-of-home food consumption. The paper concludes by considering the importance of understanding the embeddedness of food vending practices in the daily lives of the urban poor for sustainable food systems transitions in the Global South.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Everyday practices; Food practices; Practice-arrangements; Food vending; Social dynamics; COVID-19; Nigeria\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kidjie Saguin,\\r\\n',b'Why the poor do not benefit from community-driven development: Lessons from participatory budgeting,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 112,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 220-232,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.08.009.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X18303097)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Community-driven development (CDD) has been identified as a potent vehicle for poverty reduction. Over 105 countries have adopted CDD projects in the hope that citizen empowerment translates to socio-economic development. But existing evidence is mixed, with some scholars arguing that CDD does not benefit the poor. This paper seeks to contribute to this literature by identifying any differentiated impact to the poor attributable to a CDD project in the Philippines. It draws on the literature on participatory budgeting to argue that participation of the socially excluded groups like the poor in the collective planning and budgeting determines the extent to which empowerment and democratization can be sustained. Using panel data collected in 2003 and 2010, the paper finds indications of elite control based on a decomposition of the profile of participants of village assemblies, which is a critical participatory institution in providing equal access to all members of the community to the deliberations and negotiations. The average participant of such village assemblies tend to be the less-poor household of the community with the participation of the poor dwindling over the years. The difference-in-difference impact estimation also reveals disappointing results for the poor. Although the project improved average household income among the poor, the project failed to enhance the social outcomes for the poor households such as participation in planning process, trust in the government and solidarity. This study adds to the existing literature showing that CDD may fail to effectively target the poor.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Community-driven development; Participatory budgeting; Impact evaluation; Philippines\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xing Quan Zhang, Michael Ball,\\r\\n',b'Housing the planet: Evolution of global housing policies,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 54, Part 3,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 161-165,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2015.11.028.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397515302022)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Luke Fesko,\\r\\n',b'First lead, now no bed?

To combat this problem, several states have passed lead abatement laws, forcing landlords to remove lead in the homes they rent if tenants have children under the age of 6. However, these laws have unintended consequences, causing landlords to evict tenants rather than abate lead. I use a difference-in-differences approach while employing various model specifications with various fixed effects and sets of controls to examine the impact of Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2003 lead abatement law on eviction rates. Using newly collected data from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, I find that the passage of Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lead abatement law sharply increased targeted evictions. Due to the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s passage, the average census district in Ohio faced an increased eviction rate of roughly 0.457 points, corresponding to an additional 13.93 evictions a year. These impacts are highly statistically significant, sizeable, and economically meaningful, indicating that policy makers should incorporate distributional consequences when designing future lead abatement laws in order to avoid unintended consequences and ensure equitable outcomes.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Evictions; Lead abatement; Environmental justice\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'C.M.

At the household level urbanisation may drive changes in the allocation of household labour and consequently social and economic relations. Yet how these are manifest in land-based livelihood strategies of arable cropping, livestock husbandry and the collection of wild products in urban settings has rarely been considered. Here we examine the changing participation rates in land-based livelihood activities by male- and female-headed households along the rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93urban continua of six sub-Saharan African secondary towns. To capture the gendered changes in land-based livelihood strategies along the urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural continuum, 1156 randomly selected households were sampled along transects radiating out from the urban through the periurban to rural surrounds. Participation in different land-based livelihood strategies was recorded by means of a questionnaire. We show that engagement in one or more land-based livelihood activities is widespread (92% of all households), even amongst urban households (82%). We also show that there are marked changes in gendered participation for many land-based activities along the urbanisation gradient, with a general narrowing of differences in participation rates between male- and female-headed households with increasing urbanisation. These results indicate that land-based activities are components of not only rural livelihoods in Africa, but are also practiced by most urban households too, and that urbanisation reshapes some of the gendered dimensions of roles more typical of rural contexts.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Gender; Land; Livelihoods; Livestock; Urban agriculture; Wild resources (NTFPs)\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kacey C.

First, it exhibits the relationship between land and income distribution by developing a theoretical model based on Harris and Todaro (1970) and Lewis (1954). High land inequality increases income Gini coefficients in the urban sector as well as the rural sector, not only by creating congestion in the urban subsistence sector, but also by feeding the growth of the urban reserve army of labor, which pulls down the wages in the urban capitalist sector. Next, the study investigates the empirical relationship between land inequality, level of urbanization and income inequality using cross-country datasets. The estimation results support the theoretical model and indicate that the level of land inequality has a significant impact on determining the level of urbanization, and urban and overall income inequalities. Moreover, the analysis finds that overurbanization increases income inequality. The empirical analysis controls for institutional factors like education inequality and the level of democracy. The results present a stronger evidence on the land inequality\\xe2\\x80\\x99s influence through urbanization than through education and democracy. These results suggest that policymakers should have a broader view as to the importance of agrarian policies. A progressive land reform or/and subsidies protecting small peasantry can also reduce urban income inequality and poverty over the long run.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: distribution; urbanization; informality; economic development\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Natan Waintrub, Margarita Greene, Juan de Dios Ort\\xc3\\xbazar,\\r\\n',b'Designing incentive packages for increased density and social inclusion in the neighbourhood of mass transit stations,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 55,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 133-147,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2016.03.006.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397516302089)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Local and central authorities have long been interested in taking advantage of investments in mass transit to achieve more sustainable urban development. In the case of Santiago de Chile, a highly income-segregated metropolis that also suffers an increasing urban sprawl, its underground (Metro) and BRT corridor networks offer a unique chance to revert these malaises. In effect, Santiago's modern transit infrastructure is undercapitalized, there are many areas with little or no development in the vicinity of Metro and BRT stations that could be densified providing housing to the growing population, and hopefully even turned into sub centres with urban equipment, servicing the poorer areas, thus diminishing social and spatial segregation. We sought to understand and measure how different government incentive packages could attract private investment into such areas. We used a combination of stated choice and best-worst scaling data to examine the potential power of various government grants to encourage density development, including social integration, at these locations. Our results allowed us to identify a typology of urban areas that respond differently to the incentive packages. The differentiated analysis of the urban areas, their tendencies and perception of potential real estate developers is a significant first step to design ad hoc strategies to encourage sustainable development in the surroundings of Metro and BRT stations.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Densification; Stated choice; Mixed-income housing; Social integration; Incentives packages\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Theodore H.

The COVID-19 pandemic is among the most tragic epidemiologic events since the swine flu in 1917\\xe2\\x80\\x9318 and HIV/AIDS beginning in 1981, both of which killed tens of millions globally. Since the 1870s, life expectancy in industrialized countries has increased steadily, and life expectancy in developing countries has risen dramatically since the 1920s. The spread of public health and medical sciences greatly reduced the massive number of killing and crippling diseases, such as smallpox, malaria, measles, polio, and tuberculosis. Public health has evolved, addressing and shaping an epidemiologic transition in which noncommunicable diseases have become the preeminent cause of illness and death. Since the 1960s, public health and clinical medicine have developed, in tandem, a new transition emphasizing health promotion. This transition has seen dramatic success in improving life expectancy through prevention modalities, including early diagnosis and treatment. The 21st century has seen global health advance through networks of public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private and academic health organizations that have promoted crucial initiatives to expand public health to low- and middle-income countries to improve sanitation, reduce poverty, reduce maternal and child mortality, and control infectious diseases via the Millennium Development Goals to 2015, with commendable participation and success. Those goals were followed by the expanded Sustainable Development Goals to 2030. The first decades of the 21st century have witnessed a series of coronavirus and influenza pandemics. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has cast a pall over global health, with hundreds of millions of cases, millions of deaths, and a stream of viral variants that have swamped control measures. But the future of global health is ripe with positive developments, such as developing new vaccines for Ebola, malaria, and the COVID-19 virus. The evolving New Public Health faces old and new diseases, the challenges of poverty, and the inequities discussed in previous chapters. Global health will need expanded public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private cooperative health networks and initiatives to build on successes and learn from setbacks, including looming climate change, persistent social and health inequity, new global health challenges, and follow-up on many recent achievements.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Control; Disease prevention; Education and health; Elimination; Epidemiologic transition; Global health; Millennium Development Goals; Pandemics; Public\\xe2\\x80\\x93private networking; Reducing poverty and inequity in human rights; Sustainable Development Goals\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Federico Caprotti,\\r\\n',b'Critical research on eco-cities?

Eco-city projects are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and political-economic discourses in a variety of locations as new urban spaces where blueprints for low carbon economies can be trialled. In light of this, the article highlights the key necessity of, firstly, considering scale when analyzing eco-city \\xe2\\x80\\x98futures\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Secondly, the article argues for the need to interrogate eco-cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 definitions, as well as evaluation, performance and monitoring frameworks, as this will aid in critical analyses of the marketing, presentation and actually built urban environments in eco-city projects. Thirdly, the question of internal social resilience and the emergence of communities within newly-built eco-cities needs to be assessed: this is of crucial importance in light of the exclusive, gated nature of several flagship eco-city projects under construction at the time of writing. Lastly, the article argues that research on eco-city projects needs to consider not only the high-tech, new urban environments materialized as eco-cities, but also the production and reproduction of large, often transient populations of low-paid workers who build eco-cities and who form what the article calls the \\xe2\\x80\\x98new urban poor\\xe2\\x80\\x99, forming \\xe2\\x80\\x98workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the edges of flagship \\xe2\\x80\\x98sustainable\\xe2\\x80\\x99 urban projects worldwide.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Eco-city; Sustainable city; Green urbanism; Resilience\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Robert E.B.

However, this potentially important channel through which climate change may affect social welfare has not received the attention it deserves. We provide the first estimate of the long-term effects of climate change on the labor market based on the hedonic approach, which accounts for individual long-term adjustments to climate change.

Section 2 considers changes in contexts: Where are agricultural research investments most likely to be an engine of poverty reduction? Over the past 25\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears, there have been profound changes in the development context of most countries, necessitating an update on strategic insights for research investment priorities relevant for the economic, political, social, environmental, and structural realities of the early 21st Century. Section 2 briefly surveys changes in these structural aspects of poverty and development processes in low-income countries, with particular attention to new drivers (e.g., urbanization, climate change) that will be of increasing salience in the coming decades. In Section 3, we turn to mechanisms: What are the plausible impact pathways and what evidence exists to test their plausibility? Poor farmers in the developing world are often the stated focus of public sector agricultural research. However, farmers are not the only potential beneficiaries of agricultural research; rural landless laborers, stakeholders along food value chains, and the urban poor can also be major beneficiaries of such research. Thus, there are multiple, interacting pathways through which agricultural research can contribute to reductions in poverty and associated livelihood vulnerabilities. This paper introduces an ex ante set of 18 plausible impact pathways from agricultural research to rural prosperity outcomes, employing bibliometric methods to assess the evidence underpinning causal links. In Section 4, we revisit the concept of desired impacts: When we seek poverty reduction, what does that mean and what measures are needed to demonstrate impact? The papers in this special issue are intended to yield insights to inform improvements in agricultural research that seeks to reduce poverty. History indicates that equity of distribution of gains matters hugely, and thus the questions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho wins?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho loses?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d must be addressed. Moreover, our understanding(s) of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoverty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the intended outcomes of development investments have become much richer over the past 25\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears, incorporating more nuance regarding gender, community differences, and fundamental reconsideration of the meaning of poverty and prosperity that are not captured by simple head count income or even living standard measures.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Agricultural Research for Development (AR4D); Agri-food systems; Development strategy; Impact pathways; Poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Deborah L.

Previous studies reporting positive associations between child home enrichment and cognitive performance generally had a limited distribution of SES. We evaluated the associations of SES and child enrichment with cognitive performance in a population with a wide range of SES, particularly whether enrichment attenuates associations with SES. Children were sampled from a case\\xe2\\x80\\x93control study of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) conducted in a public hospital serving a low SES population (final n=198) and a private hospital serving a middle-to-high SES population (final n=253). SES (maternal education and income) and perinatal factors (SGA, maternal smoking and drinking) were obtained from maternal birth interview. Five child home enrichment factors (e.g. books in home) and preschool attendance were obtained from follow-up interview at age 4.5 years. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Differential Ability Scales (DAS), a standardized psychometric test administered at follow-up. SES and enrichment scores were created by combining individual factors. Analyses were adjusted for perinatal factors. Children from the public birth hospital had a significantly lower mean DAS general cognitive ability (GCA) score than children born at the private birth hospital (adjusted mean difference \\xe2\\x88\\x9221.4, 95% CI: \\xe2\\x88\\x9224.0, \\xe2\\x88\\x9218.7); this was substantially attenuated by adjustment for individual SES, child enrichment factors, and preschool attendance (adjusted mean difference \\xe2\\x88\\x925.1, 95% CI: \\xe2\\x88\\x929.5, \\xe2\\x88\\x920.7). Individual-level SES score was associated with DAS score, beyond the general SES effect associated with hospital of birth. Adjustment for preschool attendance and home enrichment score attenuated the association between individual SES score and adjusted mean DAS-GCA among children born at both of the hospitals. The effect of being in the lower compared to the middle tertile of SES score was reduced by approximately a quarter; the effect of being in the upper compared to the middle tertile of SES score was reduced by nearly half, but this comparison was possible only for children born at the private hospital. A child's individual SES was associated with cognitive performance within advantaged and disadvantaged populations. Child enrichment was associated with better cognitive performance and attenuated the SES influence. Health care providers should reinforce guidelines for home enrichment and refer children with delays to early intervention and education, particularly children from disadvantaged populations.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Neurodevelopmental; Epidemiology; Sociodemographic determinants; Differential Ability Scales\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Theodore H.

Human resources to provide and manage public health and clinical services are crucial to developing and sustaining national and global health systems. High-income countries are replete with highly trained and motivated personnel, but face issues such as increasing costs of care for aging populations and using new categories of health workers. Low-income countries face severe human resource shortages as training programs are underdeveloped. Health workforce issues include urban\\xe2\\x80\\x93rural differentiation, promoting standards and quality of care, specialization versus primary care, tensions between public and private health systems, and integrating new health professions. Migration of health professionals from low-income to high-income countries hampers the buildup of a critical mass of leaders, providers, and teachers to expand the capacity of health systems. Strategic policies are crucial to this field.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: community health worker; dental health training; health professional migration; human resources; nurse practitioner; nurse training; paramedical profession; physician training; primary care health provider; public health training\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Alan de Brauw, Valerie Mueller, Hak Lim Lee,\\r\\n',b'The Role of Rural\\xe2\\x80\\x93Urban Migration in the Structural Transformation of Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 63,\\r\\n',b'2014,\\r\\n',b'Pages 33-42,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.10.013.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13002258)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Summary\\r\\n',b'Rural-to-urban migration is an inherent part of the economic development process, yet it is relatively understudied in sub-Saharan Africa.

Left unaddressed, such stress contributes to burn-out and job turnover, with negative effects on client families as well as agencies and the workers themselves. In response to this problem, some child and family service organizations have encouraged the use of self-care practices to counteract the inherent stresses of these jobs. The present study reports on descriptions of stress and self-care contained in written portfolios of 99 family workers enrolled in a strength-based training program, the Family Development Credential\\xc2\\xae. As found in other research, virtually all study participants reported an over-arching sense of stress and anxiety, with specific issues of workload, client problems, and work/family imbalance most frequently mentioned. To deal with their stress, workers described a variety of self-care practices: most common were mindfulness, exercise, social connections, changing self-expectations, and time management. Results show a significant curvilinear relationship between the number of stresses and the number of self-care practices mentioned, such that workers discussing both the lowest and the highest number of stresses discussed fewer self-care practices than workers naming a moderate number of stresses. Although a similar relationship between the level of stress and individuals' ability to take advantage of available resources has been demonstrated for low-income families, to our knowledge the present study is the first empirical demonstration of this principle for people who serve such families. These findings illustrate the limits of individual self-care for dealing with high levels of stress, and suggest the importance of strengthening worker support at the agency level, as well as tailoring stress management programs to the needs of individual workers.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Family workers; Occupational stress; Self-care practices; Human service agencies\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xiaofen Chen,\\r\\n',b'Why do migrant households consume so little?,\\r\\n',b'China Economic Review,\\r\\n',b'Volume 49,\\r\\n',b'2018,\\r\\n',b'Pages 197-209,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1043-951X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2017.11.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X17301724)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Exploring data from the migrant and urban household surveys of the Chinese Household Income Project, this paper dissects the underlying causes of the depressing effect of the hukou system on migrant household consumption to two channels. On one hand, migrants' disentitlement to local urban hukou creates financial insecurity through barriers to employment, social welfare, medical insurance, etc., thereby encouraging precautionary saving. On the other hand, it promotes temporary migration, allows divergence in tastes and values from local urban residents to persist, and incentivizes migrant households to save their transitory income. Factors reflecting these two channels, such as medical and pension insurances, the duration of migration, and local homeownership, are specifically modeled, and they are found to contribute to the discrepancies in consumption between migrant and local urban households, among other factors. In addition, the marginal propensity to consume exhibits heterogeneity across migrant households; it is higher with a longer duration of migration, local homeownership, and self-employment. The lack of these attributes further reinforces the reluctance of migrant households to consume.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Consumption; Migrant household; Marginal propensity to consume\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Holger Breinlich, Gianmarco I.P.

Timely receipt of transfers yields no expenditure change relative to non-recipients. However, delayed receipt reduces expenditures by 7.5 percentage points. Ignoring heterogeneous timing leads to sizable underestimates of expenditure impacts. After considering several data-driven explanations, we reconcile these findings with models of consumption smoothing in which liquidity constraints imply asymmetric responses to positive and negative shocks.

However, this result is potentially hampered by two limitations. First, it may be contingent to the specific choices made regarding the poverty line and the poverty indices used for the analysis. As a consequence, it may collapse if one uses alternative poverty lines or poverty measures. Second, it results from a focus on the sole monetary aspects of poverty. As income does not cover all facets of well-being and since the relationship between these two concepts are quite fuzzy, it may be worth using a broader view of well-being, hence opting for a multidimensional approach of poverty analysis. In the present paper, these two issues are addressed using multidimensional stochastic dominance procedures on the joint distribution of income, education and health in seven Chinese provinces.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: China; Income poverty; Multidimensional poverty; Stochastic dominance tests\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Md.

Abating the issue, current participatory planning and collaborative actions are becoming popular. The major challenge in contemporary pro-poor housing practices is to explore the best practices of community participation, is well-discussed after the withdrawal of government intervention in housing and relying heavily on housing market. This study attempted to explore different forms of community participation to identify options introducing community-led housing in Bangkok and Mumbai for urban poor. The SWOT analyses of the ongoing projects in Bangkok and Mumbai identified scope and operational methodology of community-led housing. Results revealed that different forms of participatory practices are still considering urban poor as beneficiaries in expert-designed pre-determined projects and programmes. Community-led housing process has emerged as a different thought of action which is impulsive, inclusive and initiated by the community. We identified the elements of community-led housing are noticeable through representative networking, collective savings and blended financing, participatory designing, collective ownership, and participatory monitoring and evaluation. Although the community-led housing practice is becoming successful by enabling urban poor in five aspects, yet issue of scaling-up and institutionalization remains unsolved.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Collective savings; Community driven development; Participatory designing; Representative networking; Self-help housing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jan Baedke,\\r\\n',b'The epigenetic landscape in the course of time: Conrad Hal Waddington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s methodological impact on the life sciences,\\r\\n',b'Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 44, Issue 4, Part B,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 756-773,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1369-8486,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.06.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369848613000897)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: It seems that the reception of Conrad Hal Waddington\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work never really gathered speed in mainstream biology.

In particular, it calls attention to the legislative onslaught by city government in the years abutting the 2010 Winter Olympics to cultivate and manage healthy people, communities, and environments. In an effort to sell Vancouver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98liveability\\xe2\\x80\\x99, I argue City of Vancouver endorsed a new legislative alliance that merged a conspicuously Anglo-American wellbeing lexicon, favouring individual responsibility and self-governance, with the performing arts industries. Drawing upon interviews and performance-based research, the paper illustrates how Karen Jamieson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s community dance project Connect, created for the In the Heart of the City festival, embodies Vancouver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tri-level legislative ambitions to nurture A Healthy City For All. This materialised through the crafting of a dance-health body practice (healthy people), by choreographing a sense of belonging among \\xe2\\x80\\x98at risk\\xe2\\x80\\x99 communities (healthy communities), and in the uniting of the arts and health professions in the process of \\xe2\\x80\\x98cleaning up\\xe2\\x80\\x99 disenfranchised neighbourhoods (healthy environments). In bringing together scholarship on cultures of wellbeing and creative dance practice, the article contributes to understandings of how the health-seeking subject is embodied and performed. It also offers a productive critique of the exclusionary nature of urban health legislation, and of the contested role artists and arts festivals can play in nurturing urban wellbeing and normalising inequalities.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Creative city; Dance; Health; Governance; Vancouver; Wellbeing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Katherine J.

We focus on the social attributes of the local area to assess what the geographic place represents in terms of social characteristics, namely racial/ethnic composition and economic structure, and to resolve apparent inconsistencies in poverty research. Using spatial regime and spatial error regression techniques to analyze county census data, we examine spatial differentiation in the relationships that generate child poverty. Our approach addresses the conceptual and technical aspects of spatial inequality. Results show that local-area processes are at play with implications for more nuanced theoretical models and anti-poverty policies that consider systematic differences in factors contributing to child poverty according to the racial/ethnic and economic contexts.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Child poverty; Spatial differentiation; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial regime; Spatial regression; United States\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'J.E.

Although anecdotal evidence suggests that mentoring relationships have the potential to positively influence a range of developmental outcomes, research and evaluation on mentoring has yielded mixed results. In this article, we review the empirical literature on youth mentoring. Although overall effects tend to be modest, the impact of mentoring relationships tends to vary on the basis of the various characteristics of youth, mentors and relationships, as well as the quality and practices of mentoring programs. When mentoring is effective, it is thought to lead to positive academic, behavioral, and psychological outcomes through its influence on adolescents' socioemotional, cognitive, and identity development. Studies have provided preliminary support for these pathways, but additional research is needed to fully understand the underlying processes through which mentoring affects youth development.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Cognitive development; Identity development; Interventions; Prosocial behavior; Relationships; Resilience; Risk factors; Social support; Socioemotional development; Supportive adults; Youth mentoring\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Fernando Puente-Sotomayor, Andrea Egas, Jacques Teller,\\r\\n',b'Land policies for landslide risk reduction in Andean cities,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 107,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'102298,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2020.102298.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397520314223)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Andean cities are increasingly subjected to landslide susceptibility and events, accompanied by population and urban growth and uncertain extreme climate events. In light of this, academic and professional communities have begun to pay close attention and now face the challenge of producing more detailed knowledge and converting it into effective action. This article is based on a literature review supporting a multidimensional conceptual framework to address landslide risk reduction for the urban Andes context. It aims to complement the environmental dimension, which often shows the resulting physical condition of risk, with landslide risk root-causes by exploring socio-economic and socio-cultural dimensions and the policy and institutional apparatuses that accompany the former dimensions. We aim to identify and understand the inextricable links between the four dimensions and determine how subdimensions can operatively describe and help to understand this complexity. An example from a landslide risk-prone site in Quito illustrates the application of the framework and delivers lessons from a specific context and time. Parts of these lessons may be common for other contexts, but their understanding is critical for landslide risk reduction.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Latin America; Risk-sensitive; Land-use; Informality; Vulnerability; Social construction\\r\\n',b'\\r\\n',b'Authors,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

However, this knowledge is fragmented and little is known about how the ecosystem services provided and/or compromised by biofuels link to human wellbeing. In fact, whether biofuels production and use can have a negative or positive impact on the environment and society depends on several interconnected factors. This paper provides a critical review of the drivers, impacts and tradeoffs of biofuel production and use. In particular, it rationalizes the evidence coming from diverse academic disciplines and puts it into perspective by employing the ecosystem services framework popularized by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). An outcome of this systematic review is a simplified conceptual framework that illustrates the main trade-offs of biofuel production and use by employing a consistent language grounded on the concepts of ecosystem services. Given the almost complete lack of literature explicitly linking biofuels and ecosystem services, our review concludes by identifying priority research areas on the interface of biofuels, ecosystem services and human wellbeing.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Biofuels; Ecosystem services; Biodiversity; Human wellbeing; Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Anji Wall, Peter Angelos, Douglas Brown, Ira J.

What policies emerged in the hope of attaining that goal? The last 200 years have witnessed a dramatic change in thinking about poverty. Mainstream economic thinking in the eighteenth century held that poverty was necessary and even desirable for a country's economic success. Today, poverty is more often viewed as a constraint on that success. In short, poverty switched from being seen as a social good to a social bad. This change in thinking, and the accompanying progress in knowledge, has greatly influenced public action, with heightened emphasis on the role of antipoverty policy in sustainable promotion from poverty, as well as protection. Development strategies today typically strive for a virtuous cycle of growth with equity and a range of policy interventions have emerged to help ensure that outcome. An expanding body of knowledge has taught us about how effective those interventions are in specific settings, although many knowledge gaps remain.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Growth; Redistribution; Antipoverty policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'\\r\\n',b'Subject Index,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

Among various available renewable energy sources, India has abundance of bioenergy options that used since long time to meet the cooking and heating requirements. Bioenergy economy is totally dependent on market of supply and demands, interdependent to each other. However, traditional bioenergy applications were found as inefficient practice with harmful environment impacts. Modern bioenergy technologies have potential to fulfill the demand and supply gap of the country. Furthermore, they have high energy efficiency with low carbon emissions. Bioenergy technologies such as biogas, biodiesel, bio-ethanol and biomass gasification having potential for cooking, transport and power generation. Various bioenergy policies and programs have been introduced to accelerate the bioenergy in India in past years. However, country is unable to use adequate available potential of bioenergy options due to policy gaps. Implementation of bioenergy policy is allied with various challenges like technical, institutional, financial, environmental and social aspects. Indian government introduces the new bioenergy policy to accelerate the bioenergy based generation in India. Thus, this article attempts to explore and critically analyze the present bioenergy policies and possible options of recent Indian experiences for successful adoption of bioenergy. A survey based findings is also analyzed through logistic regression and linear regression to explain the pattern of awareness and willingness to pay for bioenergy technology with reference to biogas and improved cookstoves. We found that socio-economic variables are important parameters for the success of bioenergy policies in rural India.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Bioenergy; Bioenergy policy; Biofuel; Biogas; Bio-waste\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): Susan J.

The priorities have changed from a narrow focus on the productivity of food grains to a need for more work on natural resources management and sustainability issues; increasing the productivity and quality of high-value crops, trees, and livestock; agricultural intensification in many less favored areas; more precise targeting of the problems of the poor, including enhancing the micronutrient content of food staples; and analysis of policy and institutional options for achieving more sustainable and pro-poor outcomes in the rural sector. This study draws on the available literature to assess how successful the agricultural R&D system has been in achieving these new goals in South Asia. Overall, it finds that the R&D system has responded well to these changing needs in terms of both budgetary allocations and the kinds of research that has been undertaken. Moreover, market liberalization has enabled a more diverse set of agents to engage in agricultural R&D, and private firms and NGOs have helped ensure that important research and extension needs have not been overlooked. Findings on the impact of this evolving research agenda are mixed. The economic returns to crop improvement research have remained high and well in excess of national discount rates. Public investments in crop improvement research have also given higher returns than most other public investments in rural areas. There is little credible evidence to suggest that these rates of return are declining over time. Agricultural R&D has also made important contributions to reducing poverty in South Asia, but it has done less well in reducing interhousehold and interregional inequities. The greatest impact on poverty has been obtained by lowering food prices, but this pathway might be less important in the future now that food prices are aligned more with border prices and food accounts for a smaller share of consumers' budgets. Also, given that agriculture now plays a relatively small part in the livelihoods of many marginal farmers in South Asia, questions arise about the efficacy of continuing to target agricultural R&D to their problems. Agricultural R&D has also been successful in addressing many of the environmental problems associated with agriculture, with a demonstrated potential for favorable impacts in farmers' fields. Yet the uptake of improved technologies and management practices that reduce environmental damage has been disappointing, particularly in intensively farmed areas. Finally, a large amount of policy research has been undertaken in South Asia since the GR, and case studies show favorable returns to policy research, though the conditions under which it leads to policy change are not well understood.

Remarkably enough, urban population growth and energy poverty are mainly studied separately from each other in different strands of the literature. We argue that there is much to be gained in studying these phenomena in their interdependence. To illustrate this, we analyze for the case of Mozambique the relationship between spatial variation in population density and three commonly used indicators of energy poverty over time. We think that the case of Mozambique exemplifies the future development of Africa's energy poverty situation in many respects. Our analysis makes use of two newly constructed datasets with household level information that originate from national household welfare surveys as well as an own survey for Mozambique's capital city Maputo. The data show that over time, and especially in urban areas, energy poverty is decreasing in terms of consumption quantities and access to modern energy fuels, but increasing in terms of energy expenditure shares. Also, we show that by largely ignoring transport energy use, the national welfare surveys typically overestimate energy consumption poverty while underestimating energy expenditure poverty to a substantial degree. Finally, based on a multiple non-linear regression analysis we find, after controlling for spatial sorting of households, that if population densities rise, energy poverty levels in terms of modern fuel use first fall and then increase \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus following a U-shaped pattern. In contrast, the relationship between population density and energy expenditure poverty follows an inverted N-shaped curve. This suggests that urbanization processes in poor countries like Mozambique may not lead to an unequivocal reduction of energy poverty rates, in line with existing evidence on urbanization of poverty in Africa.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Energy poverty; Urbanization; Africa; Mozambique\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mirela Paraschiv,\\r\\n',b'Urban (in) Security and Assessment of Extreme Poverty: Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Perception Referring to Homelessness in Bucharest,\\r\\n',b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 14,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 226-236,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2012.03.022.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612004926)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In the current global economic situation, poverty stands out as a growing concern with multiple territorial aspects. Poverty is to be found both in developing and developed countries with certain differences of classification, typology, magnitude, importance, but nevertheless with some fundamental common characteristics. Homelessness represents the most extreme manifestation of poverty in urban areas. The perception of the community referring to homeless people was evaluated through 150 social surveys among residents in 18 pre-identified areas in Bucharest. Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 security and local reasons of insecurity are used as a perception differentiation instrument in the analysis. Results reflect that homelessness has a high territorial visibility in Bucharest. The phenomenon is recognized as continuously increasing, referring to territorial distribution and affected urban areas, depth and effects on different categories of population and need for more specifically directed policies and action.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; (in) security; extreme poverty; perception; homelessness; Bucharest; Romania\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Brian C.

This paper examines the link between work and poverty in rural America, drawing comparisons over time and in relation to national averages and conditions in urban areas. Using data from the 2001 to 2014 Current Population Surveys, we address three analytic objectives. First, we track changes in the share of poor householders in work, and compare the prevalence of work between the rural and urban poor. Second, we estimate trends in the share of rural and urban workers who are poor, and highlight key social and demographic differentials. Third and finally, we estimate a series of logistic regression models to assess whether and to what extent rural-urban and temporal differences can be explained by the composition of the workforce and changes therein. Results show that an increasing share of the rural poor are out of work, and that the risk of poverty among those who are employed has also increased. While some of the longstanding rural disadvantage appears to have moderated in recent years, these changes are largely due to declining conditions in urban areas. Overall, our results support pessimistic conclusions about the economic status of rural America's workforce, and the ability of rural American's to meet the basic requisites of the good life through work.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Working poor; Rural labor markets; Work; Poverty; Great Recession\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mingxing Chen, Yuwen Sui, Weidong Liu, Hui Liu, Yaohuan Huang,\\r\\n',b'Urbanization patterns and poverty reduction: A new perspective to explore the countries along the Belt and Road,\\r\\n',b'Habitat International,\\r\\n',b'Volume 84,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1-14,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0197-3975,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.habitatint.2018.12.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019739751830852X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Urbanization and poverty reduction are two vital aspects for global sustainable and healthy development. In the future, the countries along the Belt and Road will play a more important role in global urbanization and poverty reduction. Therefore, this paper aims at elaborating the characteristics and patterns of urbanization and poverty reduction in these countries using data from 1996 to 2016. The results indicate that the average urbanization level is 48% in 2016 and the average annual growth rate of these countries is 0.61 percentage points between 1996 and 2016. In addition, West Asian and Middle Eastern countries have a higher level of urbanization, while ultra-high-speed and high-speed development countries are primarily Southeast Asian countries and China. Furthermore, these countries differentiate significantly in terms of spatial distribution of population density. Regions with a population density of 0\\xe2\\x80\\x931 person per square kilometer account for 33% of the total area and 0.09% of the total population, while regions with a population density of over 1000 people per square kilometer account for 1.45% of the total area and 39.56% of the total population. Moreover, using mathematical morphology methods, we identify the 10 regions with the largest urban land areas among these countries, and seven regions are located in China and Southeast Asia. Finally, the population living in extreme poverty in these countries dropped from 1.17 billion to 355.6 million during the 20-year period, and several countries, such as China, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Mongolia, have made tremendous progress both in urbanization and poverty reduction. These findings are beneficial for comprehending urban development and poverty reduction in the countries along the Belt and Road as well as for providing references for regional cooperation.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urbanization; Characteristic; Pattern; Poverty reduction; GIS; The Belt and Road\\r\\n',b'John P.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Silvia M.

Starting in the late 1960s with the crisis in Fordism and the closing of factories, a dense population has come to inhabit these urban spaces in the midst of a process of extreme decay.

To analyze poverty and food security in Myanmar during 2020 we surveyed over 2000 households per month from June\\xe2\\x80\\x93December in urban Yangon and the rural dry zone. By June, households had suffered dramatic increases in poverty, but even steeper increases accompanied the rise in COVID-19 cases from September onwards. Increases in poverty were much larger in urban areas, although poverty was always more prevalent in the rural sample. However, urban households were twice as likely to report food insecurity experiences, suggesting rural populations felt less food insecure throughout the crisis.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: COVID19; Macroeconomic crisis; Poverty; Food insecurity; Coping strategies; Social protection\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Clionadh Raleigh,\\r\\n',b'The search for safety: The effects of conflict, poverty and ecological influences on migration in the developing world,\\r\\n',b'Global Environmental Change,\\r\\n',b'Volume 21, Supplement 1,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages S82-S93,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0959-3780,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.08.008.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937801100135X)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: This article discusses how conflict patterns affect the volume, direction and types of migration within the developing world. Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n',b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 132,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'105001,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kwok Yan Chi Jackie,\\r\\n',b'Projecting Sustainable Living Environment for an Ageing Society: The Case of Hong Kong,\\r\\n',b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 17,\\r\\n',b'2013,\\r\\n',b'Pages 675-684,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2013.02.084.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029613000868)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: In 2030, 22% of Hong Kong's total population will be aged 60 or older. In order to advocate Active Ageing1 in a qualified and sustainable environment, our research team has continuously investigated the habitable urban living environment for elderly people in Hong Kong. In 2009, we have completed a research on the practice of everyday life of an active group of elderly people. This research aimed to firstly understand how people aged 60 or above live actively in an urban environment; and secondly, to see if they are leading a quality life in Hong Kong. With this conceptual framework in mind, we wished to relate the environmental context to the ageing society. We organized the findings of this research into a conceptual framework to assess the use of urban space in Hong Kong. We wished to find out whether the use of it was fit for providing a qualified life for the older people. We find that while Hong Kong is a liveable city offering a vibrant city life, it is at the same time a \\xe2\\x80\\x98dual city\\xe2\\x80\\x99 where the high spending \\xe2\\x80\\x98nouveau riches\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is gradually expelling the poorer citizens not only from the downtown area, but also from maintaining an affordable quality of living. Our findings strongly suggested that ageing is not a barrier to an active social life. In reality, poverty is the major factor that creates both helpless and hopeless feelings among the elderly people. In order to construct a sustainable environment which is \\xe2\\x80\\x98growing old\\xe2\\x80\\x99, the Hong Kong Government should integrate the concern of the older citizens into urban planning and design policies. The most important issue is to make the city life more affordable to all.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Sustainable Living Environment; Ageing society; Active Ageing; Quality of Life; Hong Kong\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shohei Nakamura, Paolo Avner,\\r\\n',b'Spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty: The case of Nairobi,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Housing Economics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 51,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'101743,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1051-1377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2020.101743.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300796)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The inter-connectedness of workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 residential locations and job opportunities is a key determinant of labor market outcomes. This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n',b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 172,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'106388,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n',b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'John P.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mirela Paraschiv,\\r\\n',b'Urban (in) Security and Assessment of Extreme Poverty: Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Perception Referring to Homelessness in Bucharest,\\r\\n',b'Procedia Environmental Sciences,\\r\\n',b'Volume 14,\\r\\n',b'2012,\\r\\n',b'Pages 226-236,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1878-0296,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proenv.2012.03.022.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612004926)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In the current global economic situation, poverty stands out as a growing concern with multiple territorial aspects. Poverty is to be found both in developing and developed countries with certain differences of classification, typology, magnitude, importance, but nevertheless with some fundamental common characteristics.

The perception of the community referring to homeless people was evaluated through 150 social surveys among residents in 18 pre-identified areas in Bucharest. Residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 security and local reasons of insecurity are used as a perception differentiation instrument in the analysis.

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Brian C.

This paper examines the link between work and poverty in rural America, drawing comparisons over time and in relation to national averages and conditions in urban areas. Using data from the 2001 to 2014 Current Population Surveys, we address three analytic objectives. First, we track changes in the share of poor householders in work, and compare the prevalence of work between the rural and urban poor. Second, we estimate trends in the share of rural and urban workers who are poor, and highlight key social and demographic differentials. Third and finally, we estimate a series of logistic regression models to assess whether and to what extent rural-urban and temporal differences can be explained by the composition of the workforce and changes therein. Results show that an increasing share of the rural poor are out of work, and that the risk of poverty among those who are employed has also increased. While some of the longstanding rural disadvantage appears to have moderated in recent years, these changes are largely due to declining conditions in urban areas. Overall, our results support pessimistic conclusions about the economic status of rural America's workforce, and the ability of rural American's to meet the basic requisites of the good life through work.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Working poor; Rural labor markets; Work; Poverty; Great Recession\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues.

The unfolding global financial crisis, which brings higher unemployment and underemployment, is likely to further intensify this vulnerability. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban compared with the rural poor to these types of shocks. It reviews some of the unique characteristics of urban life that could make the urban poor particularly susceptible to price and financial shocks and summarizes the evidence regarding the disproportionate vulnerability of the urban poor. The focus is on impacts on poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition. The review shows that although the urban poor are clearly one of the population groups most affected by the current (and previous) crises, the rural poor, landless, and net buyers are in no better position to confront the crisis without significant suffering. The poorest of the poor are the ones who will be most affected, irrespective of the continent, country, or urban or rural area where they live. The magnitude and severity of their suffering depends on their ability to adapt and on the specific nature, extent, and duration of the coping strategies they adopt. A better understanding of how these coping strategies are used and staggered is critical to help design triggers for action that can prevent households from moving to more desperate measures. Using these early coping strategies as early warning indicators could help prevent dramatic losses in welfare.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n',b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n',b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 132,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'105001,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Robert MacTavish, Honor Bixby, Alicia Cavanaugh, Samuel Agyei-Mensah, Ayaga Bawah, George Owusu, Majid Ezzati, Raphael Arku, Brian Robinson, Alexandra M.

The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Florence Dery, Elijah Bisung, Bernard Abudho, Ophelia Soliku, George Dery,\\r\\n',b'Examining the health and wellbeing of women sanitation workers in Ghana and Kenya,\\r\\n',b'Wellbeing, Space and Society,\\r\\n',b'Volume 5,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'100167,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2666-5581,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2023.100167.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666558123000404)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: About 3.6 billion people worldwide lack access to safely managed sanitation service. To bridge service gaps, informal sanitation businesses have emerged as alternative service providers to meet the sanitation needs of unserved populations. Informal sanitation workers include persons who empty septic tanks, clean toilets, sewers, and manage public toilets. They provide a fundamental public service particularly in areas where access to municipal sanitation service is limited. Through qualitative methodologies, this paper explores the lived experiences and associated health risks of women working in the informal sanitation sector in urban Ghana and Kenya. Our findings show that female informal sanitation workers were exposed to injuries and infections, stigma and discrimination, emotional and psychological distress, sexual harassment, and unhealthy coping strategies. Distinctively, younger female participants were more likely to experience sexual harassment. Because of social stigma, many of the women developed unsafe work practices such as refusal to wear PPE and working at night. By paying close attention to the embodied effects of informal sanitation work, we can better comprehend the daily politics, lived experiences, and urban social infrastructure regimes that have a significant impact on the quality of life of informal sanitation workers. The results are also crucial for developing programs for women's empowerment and labour and social protection policies, especially in lowincome settings where gender norms interact with income disparities and other sociopolitical issues to affect women's participation in the labor market.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Informal work; Qualitative approach; Sanitation; Health\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Derek Headey, Sophie Goudet, Isabel Lambrecht, Elisa Maria Maffioli, Than Zaw Oo, Toth Russell,\\r\\n',b'Poverty and food insecurity during COVID-19: Phone-survey evidence from rural and urban Myanmar in 2020,\\r\\n',b'Global Food Security,\\r\\n',b'Volume 33,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'100626,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2211-9124,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gfs.2022.100626.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912422000177)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Myanmar first experienced the COVID-19 crisis as a relatively brief economic shock in early 2020, before the economy was later engulfed by a prolonged surge in COVID-19 cases from September 2020 onwards.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Stuart Cameron,\\r\\n',b'Whether and where to enrol?

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Vindya Hewawasam, Kenichi Matsui,\\r\\n',b'Equitable resilience in flood prone urban areas in Sri Lanka: A case study in Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division,\\r\\n',b'Global Environmental Change,\\r\\n',b'Volume 62,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'102091,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0959-3780,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2020.102091.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020303083)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Amid increasing flood incidences and damages in many parts of the world, the fundamental question arises as to the extent to which poor and marginalized residents can manage disasters by receiving equitable, fair and just support. This paper seeks to examine this question by focusing on a poor and vulnerable area of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Administratively this area is called Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division (DSD). Here mainly low-income residents live in congested housing conditions with narrow streets and poor drainage management. For years, this Division was regarded as one of the most flood vulnerable areas of Sri Lanka. To understand the resaons, we conducted our field research in this area and interviewed DSD officials and local people with three key equitable resilience dimensions in mind: distributive, procedural and contextual equities. We found that the intensity and frequency of rainfalls had increased in the area, but the residents had not received any flood protection support from the government due largely to some legal and socio-political complications. Many expressed their fear of the next flood incident. As these residents were without legal land ownership the government did not pay much attention to their needs. We also found that a low education level and a lack of political representation led to the marginalization of people in this area. Using information we collected at the Colombo DSD office and other relevant government agencies, we then examine a set of factors that are relevant to income and poverty level, population density, quality of housing, education, infrastructure and participatory decision making. The results show that flood loss and damage risks were heightened by such social vulnerability factors as low income, an unaffordability of flood resilient houses and an absence of policy implementations for flood resilient infrastructure. We also found that a lack of community leadership led to poor participation in decision making. This paper then highlights the important area for mainstreaming equitable community resilience actions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Equitable resilience; Vulnerability; Flood prone urban areas; Colombo Divisional Secretariat Division; Social vulnerability; Equity\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n',b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 172,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'106388,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n',b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 67,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n',b'Dennis R.

Findings have revealed an imbalanced SNAP participation rate among eligible populations in both suburban and rural areas. Studies on SNAP accessibility have often focused on store locations, but few have examined issues of traveling to SNAP offices. In this study, we focused on SNAP office accessibility and its association with rurality. Using Google Map API, we calculated road travel time and distance to the most conveniently located SNAP office for each block group in the conterminous United States. We investigated the degree to which the SNAP office accessibility is linked to rurality, participant demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and the program's overall participation rate. Results showed that at the block-group level, the SNAP-eligible average driving time to the most convenient SNAP office is 15.28\\xc2\\xa0min, while the SNAP-eligible average distance is 8.57 miles. More than 75% of the SNAP-income eligible population lives within a 20-min drive to a SNAP office, and 91.8% lives within 30\\xc2\\xa0min. Every ten percentage points of increase in rurality decreases SNAP office accessibility by one additional minute of car travel time. We designed a Rurality-Travel Clock (RTC) visualization tool to provide a graphic description of the urban-rural setting and SNAP office accessibility. Other observations include a noticeable cross-relationship between population concentration (e.g., white or black) and SNAP office accessibility. The findings help us to understand the dynamic relationships between SNAP participation rate and SNAP accessibility factors, including eligibility, employment status, population, and rurality at the county and state levels.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: SNAP office; Accessibility; Rurality; Poverty\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Cody B.

Research has linked exposure to nature with various benefits including improved focus, vitality, productivity, and reduced stress, factors that may enhance the academic performance of individual students. In intensively-urbanized landscapes with few natural elements this effect could, via aggregated population-level impacts, influence the academic performance of entire populations, negatively affecting educational attainment and propagating urban poverty. Designing urban environments to provide increased interaction with natural landscape elements such as vegetation could mitigate this effect, benefiting the academic growth and future success of urban students. Recent studies support this idea; however, this effect is poorly understood, hindering the management of urban environments to improve educational outcomes. This study explores relationships between urban nature and the academic performance of urban schools using the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA as a case study area. We used regression analysis to identify relationships among environmental variables on and around school campuses (i.e., tree cover, vegetated land covers, water) and four measures of population-level third-grade reading and mathematics success, accounting for school socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Contrary to expectations, we found a positive relationship between impervious surfaces and reading performance, while relationships between two vegetated land covers (grass, shrub) and water bodies and both mathematics and reading academic success were non-significant. We found a significant, positive relationship between tree cover and reading performance, suggesting that initiatives aimed at increasing tree cover in student environments could support academic success.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Green space; Academic performance; Urban environments; Vegetation; School attendance areas\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Michael Poulson, Miriam Y Neufeld, Tracey Dechert, Lisa Allee, Kelly M.

This research finds the positive prospects for low-income neighborhood households to move up, while the characteristics (e.g., racial composition) of origin and destination neighborhoods play a significant role in relocation outcomes. In addition, housing mobility programs can have various impacts on households moving from neighborhoods of different income levels. Policymakers should be aware of the diverse needs of households in extremely low-income neighborhoods (less concentrated housing assistance) and in very low-income neighborhoods (public housing) that can help them move out of concentrated poverty and move up to neighborhoods with higher income spectrums.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Residential mobility; Low-income neighborhood; Housing policy; Poverty; Urban governance\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mercedes A.

Currently, 54% of the world's population lives in cities, and an increase of 66% is expected by 2050. Based on the World Urbanisation Prospects' report, most of this growth is projected to concentrate in Asia and Africa. The resulting uncontrolled urbanisation can lead to many issues with profound impacts on health, poverty, and social inequality. Monitoring our global landscapes in the most rapidly growing regions particularly in the global south becomes thus an important endeavour. The estimation of future urban patterns become thus part of important topics that foresight the necessary support systems that efficiently cope with the carrying capacity of these urban regions. In this sense, this paper aims to i) monitor historical land cover changes in one of such major cities - Maputo, Mozambique, and, ii) project future patterns of urban fabric in its metropolitan region. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Landsat between 2000 and 2015 was collected and classified using a maximum likelihood algorithm. Spatiotemporal monitoring of urban settlements showed that within the proposed temporal scope, massive urban development took place while depleting a substantial amount of other land use types. Based on this spatiotemporal cognisance, a customized cellular automaton (CA) model was built that embeds the trends of changes while predicting future patterns. Our predictions exposed a significant amount of urbanisation will evolve over the next years if no significant controlling mechanism to cope with rapid urbanisation is integrated. Our findings, as well as conclusions, aim to aid local urban planners and policy makers in the course of urban planning in the region while taking advantage of novel open source methodologies that offer cost reduction and enable efficient monitoring for large urban extents.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Cellular automata; Urban expansion; Global south; Remote sensing; Land cover change; Predictive modelling\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'E.D.

One such inequality is the distribution of urban green spaces (UGS), which are essential to pandemic recovery. Cities that aim to be inclusive and resilient should assess whether access to their UGS is equitably distributed among the population and identify the areas where these spaces are most needed. This study therefore examines the equity of access to UGS in Mexico City at the neighborhood level using network analysis. First, access to UGS was identified at a threshold of 300\\xc2\\xa0m, regardless of UGS size. Second, access was differentiated by the functional level of the UGS, which primarily depends on their size, with larger UGS having more extensive catchment areas. The results of this study suggest a deficit of access to small green spaces in most of the neighborhoods of Mexico City, with the neighborhoods with higher rates of poverty showing an even lower average of UGS access. The results further highlight which neighborhoods in Mexico City should receive priority attention and funding for UGS to mitigate the disproportionate effects of public health crises. This is critical for future city planning and may be used as a roadmap for identifying priority neighborhoods in other cities with similar segregation patterns.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: UGS; Access; Network analysis; Functional levels; Parks\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Joan Rosen Bloch,\\r\\n',b'Using Geographical Information Systems to Explore Disparities in Preterm Birth Rates Among Foreign\\xe2\\x80\\x90born and U.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x90born Black Mothers,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic & Neonatal Nursing,\\r\\n',b'Volume 40, Issue 5,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 544-554,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0884-2175,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1552-6909.2011.01273.x.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0884217515305888)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: ABSTRACT\\r\\n',b'Objective\\r\\n',b'To examine spatial patterns of neighborhood contextual factors of stress with preterm birth (PTB) and nativity (foreign\\xe2\\x80\\x90born and U.S.\\xe2\\x80\\x90born) among Black mothers.\\r\\n',b'Design\\r\\n',b'Descriptive geographic\\xe2\\x80\\x90spatial research.\\r\\n',b'Setting & Participants\\r\\n',b'Births to Philadelphia residents during 2003\\xe2\\x80\\x902005 in the context of Philadelphia residential neighborhoods (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0350) were studied.\\r\\n',b'Methods\\r\\n',b'All data were aggregated to neighborhood levels (census tracts).

Early approaches to rural housing were concerned with the connections between housing and poverty amongst agricultural workers and the substandard physical condition of the rural housing stock. With the economic development and population growth witnessed by many rural areas in Western countries during the last three decades, academic attention has shifted to the relations between social change and housing in rural places. Within the recent rural housing literature, important efforts have been made to provide theoretically informed and empirically rich accounts of the production, regulation, and consumption of rural housing. More specifically, attention has been given to three themes: first, the interest and activities of the private capital class, that is, those actors involved in the production and regulation of rural housing; second, the shifting relations between housing, social change, and culture in rural places; and third, the nature and scale of housing needs and homelessness in rural places.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Culture; Housing; Regulation; Rurality; Society; Welfare\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Ronay Thomas, Patrick T.

Socioeconomic challenges have a significant impact on both access and adherence to appropriate treatments which, given a history of racial segregation and discrimination, disproportionately burden under-represented minorities. The distribution of socioeconomic factors, like poverty, educational attainment, and housing quality, can now be assessed routinely at the population level, yet the distribution and impact of such contextual risks in the pediatric sickle cell population have not been sufficiently described. Here, we sought to characterize the burden of neighborhood-level socioeconomic challenges and barriers among children with SCD in one large, urban county. We also sought to determine whether these area-level indicators were associated with hospitalizations and markers of adherence to SCD medications. Methods We pursued a retrospective review of electronic health record data from 2011-2017 for children with HbSS disease in the active Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center's SCD registry which includes all children receiving care within the past two years in the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center and is representative of nearly all children with SCD in Hamilton County, Ohio. The analysis was performed under an IRB-approved study investigating socioeconomic factors for children in Hamilton County. Children within the SCD registry were excluded from this analysis if they had a non-HbSS genotype or an address outside of Hamilton County. Addresses were geocoded and linked to a specific census tract which approximates local neighborhood boundaries. Once linked to a census tract, that address was connected to a pre-determined list of variables present within the 2013-2017 US Census' American Community Survey. Variables included the census tract poverty rate, educational attainment rate (percentage of adults with less than a high school education), and the percentage of vacant housing. A validated census tract-level deprivation index, assembled from 6 such census variables, was also included. Outcomes of interest included number of hospitalizations and ED visits during the study period and %HbF for the subset on hydroxyurea treatment. Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate ecological socioeconomic characteristics among included patients. Associations between area-based socioeconomic deprivation and outcomes of interest were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Results There were 141 patients with HbSS included in the analysis (53% Male, 82% publicly insured). Mean age at the end of the analysis period was 9.6\\xc2\\xb16.3 years. Consistent with the aggressive treatment strategy at our center, most (97%) were on disease modifying treatment with either hydroxyurea (81%) or chronic transfusion therapy (16%). Compared to the county as a whole, children in the registry mapped to areas with relatively high rates of poverty (median 26%; IQR 15%-42%), low rates of education attainment (median with high school degree 86%; IQR 78%-91%), and high rates of vacant housing (median 13%; IQR 8%-19%). The deprivation index is scaled between 0 and 1 with higher values indicative of more socioeconomic deprivation. In our population, the deprivation index median was 0.45 (IQR 0.36-0.61). When the sample was categorized into three deprivation groups (low < 25th percentile, medium between 25th and 75th, and high >75th percentile), we found trends toward associations with utilization and adherence measures (Table 1). Conclusion A majority of our SCD patients live in neighborhoods with stark socioeconomic challenges and barriers which have been shown to negatively affect health outcomes. There appears to be a significant trend towards increased utilization among those living in more deprived neighborhoods, although, the link with adherence was less clear. The latter finding, indicative of similar HbF levels across deprivation groupings, may be the result of efforts made by our multidisciplinary comprehensive care team to optimize care for all patients regardless of socioeconomic challenges. The data presented here are novel and likely representative of socioeconomic challenges of most SCD patients living in the US. Future, larger, multi-center studies should focus on identifying and addressing social determinants of health within this population. \\r\\n\",b'Disclosures\\r\\n',b'No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'C.M.

This study analyzed blood lead level (BLL) data collected from 2011 to 2016 from approximately 140,000 children ages <1 to 6\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears across South Carolina (SC), including urban and rural areas. Individual-level characteristics included children's age, and race/ethnicity. Block group variables examined included population by race and ethnicity, households below the poverty level, median year homes built, urban/rural classification, and percent road coverage. BLL were higher in urban compared to rural children but increased to a greater extent in rural children from age\\xe2\\x80\\xaf<\\xe2\\x80\\xaf1\\xe2\\x80\\xafyear to 2\\xe2\\x80\\xafyears. Road coverage was strongly associated with higher BLL in urban areas, and with home age more weakly, but neither road coverage nor home age was associated with BLL in rural areas. Young urban children may receive greater exposure to Pb from house dust and outdoor legacy Pb contamination, and young rural children through diet and drinking water. Black children had higher BLL in urban areas than white children, and the converse was true in rural areas. Population data indicated that rural areas had more poverty than urban areas, but strong associations between increased children's BLL and either ethnicity or socio-economic status (SES) at the block group level was not observed, likely due to distinct characteristics of poverty and geographic distribution by ethnicity in urban as compared to rural areas of SC. Individual demographics and environmental characteristics may be more closely associated with BLL than geographically aggregated SES and race/ethnicity characteristics. Interventions to reduce children's exposure to Pb should occur at as early an age as possible, and differences between rural and urban areas should be considered as interventions are developed to reduce children's BLL.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Racial differences; Spatial; Lead exposure; Environmental sources of lead\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Matias Garreton,\\r\\n',b'City profile: Actually existing neoliberalism in Greater Santiago,\\r\\n',b'Cities,\\r\\n',b'Volume 65,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 32-50,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.02.005.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275117301932)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: Greater Santiago, the capital of Chile, concentrates most of economic and political power of this nation and 35% of its population. It is a conurbation of 6 million inhabitants, comprising 37 municipalities without a metropolitan level authority, where large scale planning is executed by centralized authorities. The historic development of this metropolis was sharply modified by neoliberal policies that were implemented during Pinochet's dictatorship and by the constitutional definition of a reduced Subsidiary State. These structural reforms had a strong impact on urban development, due to the weakening and incoordination of sectoral planning agencies and the progressive accumulation of socio-spatial inequalities. After the recovery of democracy, a stronger emphasis on social policies was promoted, but public action became increasingly dependent on private providers of public goods. Nevertheless, the early adoption of modern regulations and a sustained period of economic growth have allowed for important advances in quality of life and to considerably reduce poverty levels. This article aims to provide a systemic and critical study of Greater Santiago's institutions, living conditions and the urban outcomes of market-driven planning, considering historical processes and the present contradictions in a partially modern but segregated metropolis. In conclusion, the uniqueness of Greater Santiago's neoliberal development is discussed, highlighting the concentration of power, the influence of capitals over policy design and the strong socio-spatial inequalities that reflect direct wealth circulation from natural resources extraction to financial and real estate rents, in the absence of a strong industrial sector. However, emerging policies and the expected first elected regional governments suggest ways to advance towards more inclusive, participative and intersectoral forms of public action, under the pressure of civil demands for a fairer distribution of wealth, public goods and decision power.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Chile; Urban inequalities; Planning; Housing; Transportation; Privatization\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'David Mitchell, Donald Grant, Daniel Roberge, Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, Christian Caceres,\\r\\n',b'An evaluation framework for earthquake-responsive land administration,\\r\\n',b'Land Use Policy,\\r\\n',b'Volume 67,\\r\\n',b'2017,\\r\\n',b'Pages 239-252,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-8377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.05.020.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837717302405)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: In recent years earthquakes and their secondary hazards have claimed the largest number of lives of all large natural disasters. Some of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most earthquake-prone zones are also areas of high population density. The impact is magnified by vulnerability factors including non-enforcement of building codes, knowledge gaps, urban poverty and poor governance capacity to manage and reduce earthquake risks. Poor security of land tenure and property rights increases the vulnerability of people and affects their ability to respond to natural disasters. Earthquake recovery and reconstruction provides very significant challenges for land agencies, with these challenges differing from one country to the next due to differences in the local context. Drawing on contrasting case studies in Haiti, Nepal and New Zealand this paper identifies the common post-earthquake land administration functions and challenges that may apply to many contexts. These lessons provide land agencies and other key stakeholders with a summary of the challenges an earthquake poses for land administration at different post-disaster stages. We also discuss the policy and regulatory, institutional, operational and preparedness lessons for land administration. From these lessons we propose a framework for evaluating the earthquake-responsiveness of a land administration system. This framework can be used by a land agency in an earthquake prone region, or where an earthquake has recently occurred, to assess what challenges to land administration might occur in the event of an earthquake, and the preparedness of their land administration system.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Earthquake; Risk; Response; Recovery; Reconstruction; Land administration; Land governance; Land information; Vulnerability; Preparedness; Mitigation; Evaluation framework; Haiti; Nepal; New Zealand\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Michael B.

In the former category are key social agreements, for example, that urban development will be primarily carried out by the private sector, constrained only by planning laws that are mostly in the domain of local and state governments. Examples in the latter category include efforts to solve specific urban problems such as inadequate and unaffordable housing for low-income populations, or to respond to infrastructure deficiencies in transportation. All three countries in North America \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the United States, Canada, and Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are federal in their governance structure, so policy is necessarily distributed across the levels of government. As a result, central government plays only a limited role in key aspects of urban growth, though in Mexico there is a stronger tradition of centralization of policy. Within this framework, urban policy is diverse, but falls into three broad groupings. First, land use and development underpin urbanization; policy in these areas has existed from the earliest days in all three countries, exemplified by regulation of urban form. In North America, such regulation has, to varying degrees, supported market driven development. Second, urban policy deals with management of key functions, exemplified by transportation, public health, utilities, and environmental quality. Such policy occurs at all levels of government. Third, urban policy addresses social issues that have varied over time from the acculturation of immigrants, to poverty, housing, and race relations.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Federalism; Housing; Infrastructure; Land use; Planning; Policy; Poverty; Race; Transportation; Urban\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Khaleeq Lutfi, Mary Jo Trepka, Kristopher P.

A person's community can affect his or her STI risk by the community's underlying prevalence of STIs, sexual networks, and social influences on individual behaviors. Racial residential segregation\\xe2\\x80\\x94the separation of racial groups in a residential context across physical environments\\xe2\\x80\\x94is a community factor that has been associated with negative health outcomes. The objective of this study was to examine if non-Hispanic blacks living in highly segregated areas were more likely to have risky sexual behavior. Demographic and sexual risk behavior data from non-Hispanic blacks aged 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9344 years participating in the National Survey of Family Growth were linked to Core-Based Statistical Area segregation data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Five dimensions measured racial residential segregation, each covering a different concept of spatial variation. Multilevel logistic regressions were performed to test the effect of each dimension on sexual risk behavior controlling for demographics and community poverty. Of the 3643 participants, 588 (14.5%) reported risky sexual behavior as defined as two or more partners in the last 12 months and no consistent condom use. Multilevel analysis results show that racial residential segregation was associated with risky sexual behavior with the association being stronger for the centralization [aOR (95% CI)][2.07 (2.05\\xe2\\x80\\x932.08)] and concentration [2.05 (2.03\\xe2\\x80\\x932.07)] dimensions. This suggests risky sexual behavior is more strongly associated with neighborhoods with high concentrations of non-Hispanic blacks and an accumulation of non-Hispanic blacks in an urban core. Findings suggest racial residential segregation is associated with risky sexual behavior in non-Hispanic blacks 15\\xe2\\x80\\x9344 years of age with magnitudes varying by dimension. Incorporating additional contextual factors may lead to the development of interventions that promote healthier behaviors and lower rates of HIV and other STIs.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Residential segregation; Sexual behavior; NSFG; Census; Non-Hispanic blacks\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Lauren E.

One common development of vacant lots is into parks. As such, we assessed people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beliefs and attitudes about gentrification, their levels of support of park development in low-income areas, and differences based on presence of vacant lots in their neighborhood, through an online survey of residents in St. Louis, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x94a shrinking city (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0521). We found that respondents valued investments in their neighborhood, including park development. Specifically, respondents supported signs of gentrification from those investments, but also supported preserving neighborhoods\\xe2\\x80\\x94a potentially contradictory viewpoint. When comparing by proximity to vacant lots, we found some differences in respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views. Further, respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 beliefs and attitudes about gentrification influenced their support for different types of development, particularly building parks in formerly vacant lots, if there were not vacant lots present in their neighborhood. Among residents living near vacant lots, beliefs about neighborhood change were unrelated to their attitudes toward gentrification or support of park development\\xe2\\x80\\x94suggesting that abstract beliefs about neighborhood change are not salient to their attitudes and support.

Clusters with less testing and low proportion positive tests had higher income, education, and white population, whereas clusters with high testing rates and high proportion positive tests were disproportionately black and without health insurance.

Conflict impact and poverty are the two primary drivers directly shaping migrations within poor and high-risk environments. Indirect drivers of migration include livelihood fragility, ecological and political instabilities. Conflicts overwhelmingly occur in states where much of the population is dependent upon the environment/natural resources for their livelihoods. There is little reliable evidence to suggest a link between civil conflict and climate change, however, the environmental changes occurring across developing states shape the ways in which civilians can respond to political and economic threats. The crucial point is that the communities who are subject to increasing environmental variation and disruption, through either external or internal processes, are likely to become poorer as a consequence. This poverty lessens their ability to respond to the myriad of threats in their environs, including conflict, ecological disasters, disease, or economic hardship. Hence, there is an endogeneity to conflict, precipitating factors and possible outcomes: the persistence of violence plays a determining role in the sustainability of livelihoods, poverty levels and the propensity of migration within chronically conflicted areas. Those most vulnerable to forced migration live in \\xe2\\x80\\x98chronically vulnerable areas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, which are characterized by the deterioration, loss or destruction of primary livelihood systems and productive assets, environmental degradation and deterioration of natural resources, increasing impoverishment of communities and households, geographical isolation and a dependence on relief.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Migration; Conflict; Development; Coping mechanisms; Environmental pressures\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Richard Stansfield,\\r\\n',b'Immigration and Crime in the United States,\\r\\n',b'Editor(s): James D.

The media discussion generated has focused on how to treat illegal immigrants in the country. Missing from public debate on the topic is an examination of what effect immigration has had on American society. To date, scholars have been in agreement that communities within which immigrants have settled are both safer and economically stronger. In large gateway areas, for example, immigration has been associated with lower crime rates, economic revitalization, and reductions in concentrated poverty. While the increase in Hispanic populations cannot be unequivocally tied to these positive trends, immigration has fundamentally changed the character of urban America.

This paper shows that South Africa experienced a reversal of fortunes after the arrival of European settlers in the eastern half of the country. Yet this was not because of an institutional reversal. We argue, instead, that black South Africans found themselves at the mercy of two extractive regimes: one in \\xe2\\x80\\x98white South Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and another in the \\xe2\\x80\\x98homelands\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The political and economic institutions of each of those regimes favoured a small elite: in white South Africa, whites, and in the homelands, the black chiefs and headmen. Democracy brought inclusive institutions for black residents in white South Africa but not for those in the former homelands. This is why we see mass migration to the urban areas of South Africa today, and why addressing the institutional weaknesses of the former homelands are key to alleviating the poverty in these regions where a third of South Africans still reside.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Reversal of fortunes; Population persistence; Institutional reversal; Colonial impact; Settler economy; African economic history; Traditional leaders\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Teresa Janz, Britta Augsburg, Franziska Gassmann, Zina Nimeh,\\r\\n',b'Leaving no one behind: Urban poverty traps in Sub-Saharan Africa,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 172,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'106388,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106388.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X23002061)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Despite considerable achievements in the reduction of poverty over the last decades, poverty remains conspicuously high and profound. While fast urban population growth, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, has contributed to poverty reduction, new development challenges like the urbanisation of poverty emerge. However, little is known about the state and persistence of poverty in urban areas. This study investigates urban poverty within the theory of poverty traps among urban households in Nigeria, Tanzania and Ethiopia, three countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with large urban populations and fast urban population growth. Using household panel data from the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Living Standard Measurement Study between 2008 and 2015, we test whether consumption-based poverty traps exist in these contexts. Our results show that initially poor households experience an increase in well-being over time, while richer households face a decline and remain vulnerable to falling back into poverty. As households converge to consumption levels around the $3.20 poverty line, there is considerable movement into and out of poverty over time. However, a sticky consumption floor shows that despite upward dynamics amongst the poor, some are being left behind. Finally, we argue that improved urban data is needed to identify the vulnerable middle, and to design structural policies preventing them from falling back into poverty.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Poverty trap; Sub-Saharan Africa; Consumption floor\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Meme Wang-Schweig, Paul J.

Many of these areas are violence crucibles, or areas where the causes of violence, violent outcomes, and violence consequences are so intertwined that they cannot be separated cleanly. We use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfavela\\xe2\\x80\\x9d generically, to refer to the large periurban populations ringing core cities globally. To assist in understanding these areas, we consider the variables poverty, income inequality, rapidity of growth, population density, age structure, rural-to-urban migration, and competition for limited resources, particularly land-grabbing practices. Urban gangs are presented as a measure of state power. Illicit markets, under the immediate control of local gangs and more distant control of organized crime syndicates, are discussed for their plasticity, which refers to their ability to relocate rapidly in changing environmental conditions. Because urban government and businesses are tied to physical structures, they are much more economically at risk to sea-rise and other global warming hazards than are illicit organized crime. Moreover, organized crime is rapidly globalizing, already consuming about 10% of the global gross product. As aspects of the urban physical environment deteriorates in conditions of global warming, illicit organized crime looks poised to take increasingly large shares of the legal marketplace and to outcompete municipal police for the provision of security.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Favela; Global illicit trade; Crime urbanization; Urban violence correlates; Violence crucibles; Periurban zones; Global poverty; Land grabbing; Illicit market plasticity; Urban gangs; Street model of illicit marketplace\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Jason Knight, Russell Weaver, Paula Jones,\\r\\n',b'Walkable and resurgent for whom?

Such calls are often for the kind of high density, mixed-use urbanism that existed prior to the automobile era. Notably, many older industrial cities once exhibited this style of urbanism, and were characterized as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalking cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. More recently, these cities have battled persistent population loss, economic contraction, physical deterioration, and auto-oriented development. As such, their landscapes of walkability may now be fractured or uneven. Moreover, redevelopment efforts that champion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalkability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in such places are regularly targeted toward stable and gentrifying neighborhoods, rather than more distressed areas where resident mobility is comparatively limited. This paper engages with these and related themes for Buffalo, NY\\xe2\\x80\\x94a classic American \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshrinking city\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94to understand if/how walkability varies for different socioeconomic and demographic groups. We use WalkScore\\xc2\\xae data measured at the census block group-level to study the geographies of walkability relative to selected socioeconomic attributes. We find that walkable block groups are highly clustered in certain parts of the city, that housing values in walkable areas are increasing, and that individuals in poverty and members of certain minority groups live in block groups with disproportionately low WalkScore\\xc2\\xae. Crucially, the city features several clusters of limited mobility wherein walkability is poor and residents have insufficient access to automobiles. These results suggest that social justice must be a prominent element in urban redevelopment strategies that call for investments into \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalkability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Daniel Oviedo Hernandez, Helena Titheridge,\\r\\n',b'Mobilities of the periphery: Informality, access and social exclusion in the urban fringe in Colombia,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n',b'Volume 55,\\r\\n',b'2016,\\r\\n',b'Pages 152-164,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2015.12.004.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692315002380)\\r\\n',b\"Abstract: The relationship between transport, poverty and social exclusion has increasingly held an important place in both research and policy agendas, particularly in industrialised countries. While this has helped consolidate an emerging body of theory concerned with the social consequences of mobility, our understanding of these dynamics in the context of high vulnerability and poverty in the Global South is still relatively undeveloped. Through the case of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Colombia's capital, Bogot\\xc3\\xa1, this paper explores travel strategies in a context of scarce provision of transport which, when combined with acute conditions of low-income and segregation, limit vulnerable populations' access to the city. The travel practices, perceptions and priorities of low-income populations in deprived areas of the Global South are analysed, using a framework of transport-related social exclusion, to critically examine the elements that play a role in gaining access to the city. The emergence of adaptable methods, relations and transactions between demand and supply that allows deprived populations to reduce their risk of becoming socially excluded show potential for conceptual and practical development in addressing and analysing transport-related social exclusion.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Transport; Social exclusion; Urban periphery; Developing countries; Colombia\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Amresh D.

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues. This paper addresses a gap in the international literature on the problems many cities in developing countries face, in trying to adapt to a changing climate.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Developing cities; Policies; Poverty; Vulnerability\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Przemys\\xc5\\x82aw \\xc5\\x9aleszy\\xc5\\x84ski,\\r\\n',b'How to recognize the threat of social energy exclusion?

This problem is also increasingly affecting cities. As a result of these processes, the problem of providing energy for households, including for the purpose of heating apartments and houses, will increase. Against this background, the main purpose of the article is to propose a method for early identification of areas with potential energy poverty risks. This consists of identifying the sources of energy generation in 954 Polish towns and cities against the background of demographic changes, identifying the types of cities and communes with different risks in the future and, consequently, assessing the importance of social energy exclusion. The study used detailed data for cities and communes: demographic forecast 2021\\xe2\\x80\\x932030, data on heating sources, database of address points of residential buildings. This made it possible to develop a typology of cities and assess the scale of the threat of poverty and energy exclusion in the future in the context of social development, as well as to identify places in Poland that require stronger action by the state and local governments to improve the quality of life. These are mainly peripheral areas in each of the 16 provinces, located far from the regional capitals, including in the central, northern and eastern parts of the country.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Energy exclusion; Energy poverty; Depopulation; Urban shrinkage; Population aging; Poland\\r\\n',b'\\n',b\"Maryia Bakhtsiyarava, Leah H.

In the United States, African American mothers are twice as likely as mothers of other racial and ethnic groups to have a preterm and/or low birth weight infant, the phenomenon of which cannot be explained by maternal and infant characteristics alone. There is increasing evidence that maternal exposure to structural factors that sort African Americans into racially segregated neighborhoods also increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes, independent of individual-level differences and area-level poverty. Mothers living in racially segregated urban neighborhoods also experience higher levels and more frequent exposures to crime and environmental contaminants. Stressors associated with the interaction of segregation and poverty (i.e., concentrated poverty) can increase the susceptibility of individuals living in these neighborhoods to the adverse health effects of crime-related stressors and contaminants.

The ability of high quality preconception, prenatal and neonatal-perinatal health care to offset some of the detrimental effects associated with neighborhood risks is also discussed.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Built environment; Infant health; Maternal health; Neighborhood risks; Neonatal-perinatal health care; Preconception health care; Prenatal health care; Racial residential segregation; Teratogens\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Justus Kithiia,\\r\\n',b'Climate change risk responses in East African cities: need, barriers and opportunities,\\r\\n',b'Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability,\\r\\n',b'Volume 3, Issue 3,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 176-180,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1877-3435,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.12.002.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343510001417)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The intensity of future climate change impacts is likely to increase current vulnerabilities and further reduce existing adaptive capacities in major urban areas of East Africa. The current urbanisation of poverty in the region has caused huge intra-urban social inequalities, and presents an enormous challenge for these cities to become economic growth engines in a global network of cities, capable of delivering adequate services and quality of life for their rapidly growing population. The impacts of uncertain climate change are expected to further compound the destitution of the urban poor in addition to affecting both local and national economies. Yet, the governing authorities are yet to appreciate the synergies between successful climate change risk responses and sustainable urban development initiatives instead of viewing it as an add-on to overall strategies driven by economic and spatial concerns.\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Roberto Cantoni, Federico Caprotti, Jiska de Groot,\\r\\n',b'Solar energy at the peri-urban frontier: An energy justice study of urban peripheries from Burkina Faso and South Africa,\\r\\n',b'Energy Research & Social Science,\\r\\n',b'Volume 94,\\r\\n',b'2022,\\r\\n',b'102884,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2214-6296,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2022.102884.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629622003875)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Most of the global population that lack access to electricity services live in sub-Saharan Africa.

In this fieldwork-based study, conducted through population surveys and interviews in the peripheries of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, and Cape Town, South Africa, we employ a hybrid theoretical framework, based on work in urban political ecology and energy justice, to analyze the situation of electricity access in the two areas.

However, socio-spatial factors can limit access to healthcare services, especially for vulnerable populations. This paper aims to quantify the spatial accessibility to healthcare services by public transport across eight major Canadian metropolitan areas and compare accessibility to healthcare across vulnerable population groups. This is the first study, to the authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 knowledge, to conduct an assessment of accessibility to hospitals by public transport across multiple metropolitan regions in Canada, thereby allowing to identify common trends, challenges, as well as knowledge gaps.\\r\\n',b'Methods\\r\\n',b'Spatial accessibility to general medical and surgical hospitals by public transport was measured through a two-step floating catchment area method, considering both service-to-population ratios and travel time to these health services. For each metropolitan area, the average accessibility of all census tracts and the average accessibility of the 20% most vulnerable census tracts were calculated. To quantify vertical equity, an indicator was subsequently developed using the Spearman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rank correlation coefficient between accessibility and vulnerability.\\r\\n',b'Main findings\\r\\n',b'Within metropolitan areas (except for Vancouver), residents of vulnerable census tracts generally have greater access to hospitals by public transport.

This is probably one of the greatest dilemmas in our society, in the globalized world and in regions like Latin America in particular. In the framework of governmentality studies, this paper presents advances in research geared towards characterizing schooling practices in contexts of extreme urban poverty, specifically in an area on the outskirts of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with one of the highest concentrations of shantytowns. Starting in the late 1960s with the crisis in Fordism and the closing of factories, a dense population has come to inhabit these urban spaces in the midst of a process of extreme decay.

An abundance of data at the national and sub-national level is available, but the ability to measure health within urban conurbations has been limited. The deficiency is most evident in the megacities of low and middle income countries (LMICs), whose sprawling slums often lack basic infrastructure\\xe2\\x80\\x94water, sewage disposal, a resilient built environment, transportation. High income counties are deficient as well. Their patchwork of opulence and poverty does not respect traditional administrative jurisdictions and identifying adequate markers of poverty and ill-health is a challenge. Urban metrics have tended to devolve on a set of indicators, often combined using an arbitrary weighting system, that attempt to define the differences within and among urban areas. More recently, general purpose metrics\\xe2\\x80\\x94flexible methods rather than fixed measures\\xe2\\x80\\x94have been adopted to permit local planners and health workers to use local data for small area comparisons. The overall purpose is to use available markers to assess the influence of personal risks and behaviors, the built environment, pollution (air, water, noise, garbage), climate change, and social environment on the level of health within a community and the health disparities among them.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Built environment; Climate change; Determinants; Health; Health disparities; Heat islands; Heterogeneity; Indicators; Metrics; Pollution; Poverty; Slums\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Anand Sahasranaman, Lu\\xc3\\xads M.A. Bettencourt,\\r\\n',b'Life between the city and the village: Scaling analysis of service access in Indian urban slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 142,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'105435,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105435.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X21000474)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The emergence of India as an urbanized nation is one of the most significant socioeconomic and political processes of the 21st century. An essential feature of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s urbanization has been the growth and persistence of slums in its fast-developing cities. Whether living conditions in Indian slums constitute a path to human development or a poverty trap to much of their population is therefore an issue of vital importance. Here, we analyse data from the Census of India using the framework of urban scaling to systematically characterize the relative properties of Indian urban slums, focusing on attributes of neighborhoods such as access to basic services like water, sanitation, and electricity. We find that slums in larger cities attract more migrants and offer, on average, higher levels of service access than those in smaller cities. We posit that these outcomes are a consequence of both agglomeration effects in larger cities and sub-linear scaling of infrastructure as predicted by urban scaling theory. We also find consistent under-performance in service access in slums, in comparison with non-slum neighborhoods in the same cities. However, urban slums, on average, offer greater access to services than rural areas. This situation, which we quantify systematically, may help explain why larger Indian cities have remained attractive to rural populations in terms of living standards, beyond the need for an economic income premium. Finally, based on the analysis of scaling residuals, we construct a nationwide urban geography of slums, essentially finding that public service delivery in the slums of northern, central, and eastern Indian cities is, on average, poorer than slums in cities of southern and western India. Overall, these findings suggest that urban policy needs to confront two distinct kinds of urban inequity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 across neighbourhoods within cities, and across city scales and levels of development.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: India; Slums; Infrastructure; Scaling; Cities; Service delivery\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Shohei Nakamura, Paolo Avner,\\r\\n',b'Spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty: The case of Nairobi,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Housing Economics,\\r\\n',b'Volume 51,\\r\\n',b'2021,\\r\\n',b'101743,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 1051-1377,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhe.2020.101743.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137720300796)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: The inter-connectedness of workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 residential locations and job opportunities is a key determinant of labor market outcomes. This study provides an analysis of the spatial distributions of job accessibility, housing rents, and poverty in a large African city. In Nairobi, Kenya, workers and jobs are not well connected: On average, residents can access fewer than 10 percent of existing jobs by foot within an hour. Even using a minibus, they can reach only about a quarter of jobs. This study further demonstrates that poorer households and residents living in informal settlements are even more limited. Living closer to job opportunities is costly in Nairobi. Not only are housing quality and living conditions frequently better in such areas, but the high value placed on job accessibility also makes these areas more expensive. This severely affects the residential location choices of low-income households.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Job accessibility; Urban poverty; Slums; Urban planning; Housing rent\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'G.D.

By the same token, in a context of spatially concentrated income-earning opportunities and other urban functions, as well as limited purchasing power, accessibility to adequate means of connectivity with the rest of the urban fabric can be a determining factor in overcoming conditions of poverty for residents in physically marginal areas. Within the framework of the splintering urbanism thesis, and using the case study of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Bogot\\xc3\\xa1, Colombia's capital city, we examine the apparent mismatch between the growth of low-income informal settlements in peripheral locations and the development of transport networks in the period 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932010. Our aim is to identify the effects on social and spatial marginalisation of an uneven provision of material infrastructures and services for mobility. We identify central elements in the structure of the networks of connectivity between Bogot\\xc3\\xa1 and Soacha, highlighting the main gaps that lead to a fragmented set of connections. We develop a set of criteria for planners and policy makers searching for a more informed analysis of transport supply and policy development practice for poor peripheral populations in similar regions and contexts.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Transport networks; Splintering; Inequality; Transport policy\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'John P.

The chapter begins with a discussion of migration patterns as they pertain to megacities\\xe2\\x80\\x94cities over 10 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and megadeltas, which are large cities located on expansive, fertile coastal deltas around the world. Several megacities are briefly reviewed. We discuss their projected population growth, their access to fresh water, and their precarious locations on low-lying, ocean-facing deltas. Next, we discuss the megacity phenomenon. Modernization, as it occurred in the United States and Europe in the nineteenth century, is only now occurring in the developing world. Citizens across the globe seek the same advantages produced by earlier waves of modernization. A consequence of this is urbanization, which is the steady movement of people from rural to urban areas, with the vast majority moving to megacities. Increasingly, the cities are a core city surrounded by a large zone characterized by migrant settlers, inequality, and poverty. Some of these zones contain millions of citizens, and the core city cannot afford basic services such as sewer, security, water, and public health care. Consequently, they are vulnerable to high levels of crime of all types, and increasingly, of organized crime. These areas are fated for disaster: they tend to be where the oceans are inundating low areas of the city.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Megacities; Megadeltas; Dhaka; Modernity lag; Megacity fragmentation; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlanet of Slums,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Globalization of crime; Megacity flood-attributable losses; Megacity youth bulge; Megacity violence\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Dana R.

The WPG-Constrained model, which included building footprint auxiliary datasets, far more accurately estimated the population in all grid cells (including rural areas), and the inclusion of slum training data further improved estimates such that SDG 11.1.1 was estimated at 27.1% and 27.0%, respectively.

In 2012, the Colombian government launched a large-scale social housing program to alleviate the housing deficit caused by conflict and furthermore compensate the IDPs for their losses. The principles of this initiative are in line with the wishes of most victim families, who prefer to stay in the cities to which they moved due to the conflict. The new apartments and houses are provided free of charge and are in high demand. That may help to explain the lack of success of another large-scale reparation program, land restitution, which promotes the return of displaced households to the countryside. Building on empirical qualitative field data, this article shows how the free housing program \\xe2\\x80\\x98cements\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the choice of displaced families to continue living in cities and further develop their post-conflict urban livelihoods and social networks, as opposed to returning to the depopulated rural areas and re-establishing agricultural activities.

There has also been limited consideration among policymakers and risk managers, who tend to concentrate on large-scale risk management. Drawing on the analysis of vulnerability of urban populations in India and its changes over three periods (2004\\xe2\\x80\\x9305, 2009\\xe2\\x80\\x9310, and 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x9312), this study contributes to filling these gaps as well as emerging discussion on urban risk management. For the purpose of our study, we have developed Composite Urban Vulnerability Index (CUVI) based on 13 indicators that shape the vulnerability of an urban society. The analysis reveals that at national level, social vulnerability has declined considerably over the study periods. There is clearly a heavy concentration of social vulnerability in central and eastern states, such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, attributable to the high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. Only the urban populations in relatively prosperous Northern and Southern states are relatively less vulnerable to climate change. The results signify that while social communities in urban areas across India are, in general, developing resilience to climate change, large contrasts exist due to the socioeconomic and geographical differentiation among states.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Poverty; Inequality; Climate change; Urban; Social vulnerability; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Satya Surbhi, Elizabeth A.

The proposed method customization is being employed in the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute-funded Management Of Diabetes in Everyday Life (MODEL) study to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect for patient-centered diabetes self-care interventions across the rural-urban spectrum. The proposed suburban/rural vs. urban core classification scheme modification is based on research showing that increasing suburban poverty and rapid conversion of many rural areas into suburban areas in the U.S. has resulted in similar health care access problems in areas designated as rural or suburban.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2The RUCA coding scheme was developed when a much higher percentage of U.S. individuals resided in areas with very low population density.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Using the MODEL study example, this study demonstrates that the RUCA classification scheme using ZIP codes does not reflect real differences in health care access experienced by medically underserved study participants.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Both internal and external validation data suggest that the proposed suburban/rural vs. urban core customization of the RUCA geographic coding scheme better reflects real differences in healthcare access and is better able to assess the differential impact of clinical interventions designed to address geographic differences in access among vulnerable populations.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban-rural classification; Diabetes; Medically underserved populations; Patient-centered outcomes research; Multiple chronic conditions; African American\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'P.

Even though poverty today remains predominantly a rural phenomenon, there is a need to better understand the landscape of poverty in urban areas. Drawing on small-area estimation methods we estimate welfare outcomes at the level of individual towns and cities in Vietnam, including even the smallest towns. Such estimates could not be produced using national sample surveys alone. Results show an inverse relationship between poverty and city size in Vietnam, with the urban poor being disproportionately concentrated in small towns and cities. This relationship is robust to the location of the poverty line as well as to alternative city-size definitions. Interestingly, our evidence of a clear gradient between absolute poverty and city size is not replicated for subjective welfare, measured by self-reported food sufficiency. The absolute poverty-city size gradient does, however, accord with the observation of striking variation in service availability across cities of different size in Vietnam. Small town residents are typically confronted with far lower per-capita availability of basic services than are large city dwellers. The results suggest that policymakers concerned to tackle urban poverty in Vietnam should not neglect attending to smaller towns. Addressing inequalities in access to key basic services across the entire urban population may represent one means to this end.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban poverty; Subjective welfare; Small area estimation; Vietnam\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Emily Rains, Anirudh Krishna,\\r\\n',b'Precarious gains: Social mobility and volatility in urban slums,\\r\\n',b'World Development,\\r\\n',b'Volume 132,\\r\\n',b'2020,\\r\\n',b'105001,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0305-750X,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20301273)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Nearly one sixth of the global population lives in urban \\xe2\\x80\\x9cslums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 areas characterized by inadequate infrastructure and tenure security. This figure continues to grow as developing countries rapidly urbanize. Yet, the implications of these trends for urban poverty and social mobility are not well understood. While some argue slums provide temporary housing for rural migrants as they accumulate savings and eventually move to middle class neighborhoods, others argue slum residents are stuck in poverty traps. Deficits in longitudinal data on slums make it difficult to analyze the extent of social mobility. We iterate between satellite analysis and field knowledge to build an original sample of more than 9000 slum households across more than 200 slums from three Indian cities. To address the limitations inherent in cross-sectional data, we employ multiple methods and triangulate findings across household survey data, neighborhood focus group data, longitudinal satellite data, and in-depth qualitative interviews. While no one analysis is definitive on its own, all of these results point to the same conclusion: slum residents are neither stuck in poverty traps nor are they on a steady trajectory to joining the middle class. Movement out of neighborhoods, particularly to non-slum neighborhoods, is rare. Most households experience upward mobility within their neighborhoods, but the extent of improvement is capped at a low level, and, as opportunities increase, volatility increases in parallel. Plateauing and volatility are features present in low-end, and even more, in high-end slums. Engendering better livelihood opportunities requires reducing downward mobility while addressing the causes of plateauing upward mobility.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Slums; Informality; Social mobility; Methods; Satellite data; India\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Xinyi Wang, Laurence L.

However, achieving an equitable and just transition in cities presents challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations. Among these vulnerable groups, older people are particularly affected by energy poverty, facing inadequate access to clean and modern energy. Yet, the linkages between their energy poverty and fuel choices remain underexplored, especially in urban areas outside the Global North context. This study focuses on China, a fastest-aging country, and aims to understand why some older people in affluent urban areas continue to burn honeycomb coal briquettes. By analyzing older people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective experiences and objective connections to their fuel use, we uncover their lived experiences with energy poverty. We extended the \\xe2\\x80\\x98Energy Cultures Framework\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by including older people's vulnerability attributes alongside their material culture, norms, practices, and external influences. Using semi-structured interviews and participant observations in urban Wuhan, we found two patterns of dirty fuel stacking among older people facing energy poverty: passive and active dirty stacking. Passive dirty stacking is mainly caused by older energy-poor individuals' material culture, external influences, and vulnerability attributes; whereas active dirty stacking is primarily associated with their norms, practices, vulnerability attributes, and related external factors. Our findings provide strong implications for social and energy policy, particularly regarding the characterization of energy poverty, regulatory and infrastructural responses, social justice, grassroots governance, energy literacy, and cultural compatibility.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Fuel choices; Energy poverty; Energy culture; Older people; Urban China\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Neil Debbage,\\r\\n',b'Multiscalar spatial analysis of urban flood risk and environmental justice in the Charlanta megaregion, USA,\\r\\n',b'Anthropocene,\\r\\n',b'Volume 28,\\r\\n',b'2019,\\r\\n',b'100226,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 2213-3054,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2019.100226.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305419300372)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Previous research exploring the environmental justice implications of urban flood hazards has produced contrasting results due to the different dasymetric mapping techniques used, the various spatial scales of the analyses, and the specific geographical context of the individual study cities, particularly as it relates to the presence of coastal water-based amenities. To better understand if vulnerable populations are disproportionately exposed to urban flood hazards in non-coastal cities, this study assessed the magnitude of socio-economic inequities in flood risk throughout the Charlanta megaregion. Specifically, population characteristics within the 500-year flood zone were estimated using United States Census Bureau data for race, ethnicity, and poverty by applying three dasymetric mapping techniques at four spatial scales. Risk ratios were used to statistically evaluate if vulnerable populations were overrepresented in areas at risk for flooding overall as well as for lake and non-lake regions. Although the results varied according to the scale and socio-economic variable, the most accurate dasymetric mapping approach indicated that environmental injustices were systemic, as vulnerable individuals were between 14% and 42% more likely to reside in areas at risk for flooding when analyzing the entire megaregion. At the metropolitan scale, vulnerable individuals were still significantly more likely to reside in flood zones, and the influence of lake amenities on the disparities was nuanced. A complex spatial landscape of inequities was also observed at the county and census tract levels. Overall, the notable disparities faced particularly by non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations suggest that urban flood risk inequities in the megaregion are largely due to structural forms of discrimination and residential segregation, which have been pervasive throughout the development of Charlanta.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban flood hazards; Environmental justice; Vulnerability; Charlanta megaregion; Dasymetric mapping\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Walter Leal Filho, Desalegn Yayeh Ayal, Desalegn Dawit Chamma, Marina Kovaleva, Gabriela Nagle Alverio, Daniel M.

This is especially so in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, particularly Kenya and Ethiopia, where extreme weather events have led to rangeland degradation, crop failures, water shortages, and food insecurity. Hence, there is a perceived need to understand these processes better. Against this background, this paper reports on a study investigating the processes associated with climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia. The research method used consisted of an expert-driven assessment approach, which assesses the causes of climate-induced migration in Kenya and Ethiopia and its human and social implications on local communities. Data were collected from 110 experts residing and working on climate and migration-related issues in Ethiopia and Kenya via e-mail, whose knowledge of the current situation has enabled the identification of some important trends. The results show that climate change is a primary trigger of migration both internally and externally. The high number of migrants, many of whom living within levels of poverty in their home areas is straining resources and services in the receiving regions. Their presence is also leading to increased competition for jobs and resources. Additionally, it has increased urban poverty, as many migrants have little access to living space and health care. This paper provides a welcome addition to the literature in that it lists the causes and implications of climate-induced migration and, by doing so, fosters a better understanding of the current crisis and its implications. The implications of this paper to the overall knowledge of climate change and migration are twofold. First, it highlights the need for governments, international organisations, and other stakeholders better to understand the complex linkages between climate change and migration. Secondly, it shows the usefulness of better recognising how climate change can drive migration and the other factors shaping the decision to migrate. The paper concludes by stating the urgent need for policies and programmes that support climate change-induced migrants. Also, it draws attention to the usefulness of promoting sustainable development in their origin countries and destinations, so that migration is not necessarily perceived as the only response to climate change. A further conclusion is that there is a perceived need for providing access to resources such as education, health care, and livelihood opportunities and establishing mechanisms to ensure a safe and dignified return for those who choose to do so.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Climate change; Ethiopia; Kenya; Gender; Migration; COVID-19\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Anne Doroth\\xc3\\xa9e Slovic, Diego Bogado Tomasiello, Mariana Giannotti, Maria de Fatima Andrade, Adelaide C.

The Municipality of S\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo, one of the world's megacities, reflects this uneven accessibility, marked by urban disparities and segregation of poverty-stricken groups. This study examines the inequalities in job accessibility and how it overlaps with socioeconomic indicators, life expectancy and infrastructure conditions, constituting multiple barriers to the most deprived populations. To capture this data, two extreme ends of the human development index have been selected: below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI). The level of job accessibility was calculated considering proximity to the public transport network. The public transport network was developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) from buses to measure travel times and to compute accessibility. Additionally, a spatial autocorrelation method considering job accessibility and HDI was applied to better explore the spatially overlapped pattern. Results have showed that lower rates of job accessibility are associated with areas of worse socioeconomic condition, where life expectancy is shorter and infrastructure is disproportionally precarious. In addition to facing longer travel times in public transportation, this lowest HDI percentile faces the overlapping inequalities that prevent their social ascension and inclusion. Highlighting these factors is essential in the search for equity in accessibility and the development of more inclusive transport policies.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Transport; Job accessibility; Urban inequity; S\\xc3\\xa3o Paulo\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Hal Pawson, Shanaka Herath,\\r\\n',b'Dissecting and tracking socio-spatial disadvantage in urban Australia,\\r\\n',b'Cities,\\r\\n',b'Volume 44,\\r\\n',b'2015,\\r\\n',b'Pages 73-85,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0264-2751,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2015.02.001.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275115000165)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Despite over 20years of uninterrupted economic growth and population expansion, distinct concentrations of poverty and disadvantage remain extant in all Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major conurbations.

Urban agriculture (UA) has gained a prominent role in urban greening and food system diversification strategies alike. Despite that it is the preeminent form of food production in North American cities, residential gardening has received little scholarly attention. Moreover, research on the intra-urban variability of home gardens is sparse. In this paper, we use a mixed-methods approach to assess the scale and scope of residential gardens in Portland, Oregon, a metropolitan region renowned for its innovations in sustainability. Using a combination of mapping, spatial regression, and a mail survey, we compare residential UA and the characteristics and motivations of gardeners in two socioeconomically differentiated areas of Portland and one of its major suburbs. Results demonstrate that engagement in UA is differentiated along both spatial and socioeconomic lines, with more educated respondents engaging for environmental reasons and more lowincome respondents relying on their gardens for food security. We contextualize our findings within broader urban processes, e.g. reinvestment in the urban core and displacement of poverty to the periphery. For policymakers, our results suggest the need for sustainability messaging that is sensitive to a variety of motivations and that resonates with a diverse population. For a city to reach a broader population, it may need to reframe its sustainability goals in new ways, while attending to the structural constraints to food access that cannot be resolved through local food production alone.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Equity; Food systems planning; Gardens; Mixed-methods; Sustainability; Urban agriculture\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kelly M.

Asthma is currently one of the most prevalent chronic childhood diseases. Over the past three decades, the greatest increases in asthma rates have been in urban areas and have disproportionately affected youth in poverty and those in racial and ethnic minority groups. Neighborhoods serve as a mechanism fostering environmental injustice and perpetuating these disparities in health outcomes and life opportunity for our most vulnerable populations. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) methods in a case study of St. Louis Missouri, this study examines local environmental risk by identifying \\xe2\\x80\\x98hotspots,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or statistically significant spatial clustering of high or low levels of childhood asthma, and associations with neighborhood characteristics, socio-demographic characteristics, and access to healthcare resources within these hotspots. Results revealed statistically significant clustering of high asthma rates in areas with more non-White and poor residents, higher rates of public housing, deteriorating housing, and violent crime. High asthma hotspots were also located in areas with limited physical access to healthcare resources, such as physicians and medication, and lower school attendance rates. Residents of these high asthma hotspots experience greater environmental risk, and significant disparities in health and education outcomes, physical and financial healthcare resources, and overall well-being. This study demonstrates these place-based inequalities and presents clear evidence of environmental injustice, supporting the need for investments and interventions to improve the environments, health, and economic resources of our most vulnerable youth.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Asthma; Health disparities; Environmental injustice; Geospatial analysis; Segregation; Education; Healthcare access; Housing\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Kevin A.

The study included 161,619 women 40+ years old diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 -2006 in ten participating US states. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis for the entire study population and by state. Poverty was independently associated with late-stage in the overall population (poverty rates >20% OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.26- 1.35) and for 9 of the 10 states. Geographic access was not associated with late-stage diagnosis after adjusting for CT poverty. State-specific analysis provided little evidence that geographic access was associated with breast cancer stage at diagnosis, and after adjusting for poverty, geographic access mattered in only 1 state. Overall, compared to women with private insurance, the adjusted odds ratios for late stage at diagnosis among women with either no insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare were 1.80 (95% CI = 1.65, 1.96), 1.75 (95% CI = 1.68, 1.84), and 1.05 (95% CI 1.01, 1.08), respectively. Although geographic access to mammography was not a significant predictor of late-stage breast cancer diagnosis, women in high poverty areas or uninsured are at greatest risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer regardless of geographic location and may benefit from targeted interventions.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Breast cancer; Access to care; Cancer stage at diagnosis; Cancer survival; Urban/rural\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Anna G.

In the United States, it was legal and widely practiced well into the 1960s and has persisted in varying forms since. The Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) was one of many institutions engaging in racially discriminatory practices and created neighborhood appraisal maps in the 1930s based in part on race, ethnicity, and economic class of a neighborhood's residents. Using these HOLC neighborhood boundaries, we compared 12 present day population characteristics including health, employment, education, and income measures in each of the four HOLC neighborhood ratings across 14 U.S. cities. We used population-weighted logistic regression for paired data comparison and unsupervised learning techniques to uncover the consistency between HOLC evaluations and today's socio-economic and health outcomes. While existing literature focuses on case studies of particular cities and outcomes, we took a broad view and found consistent relationships over our study's cities and variables with few exceptions. Though there are many factors that contribute to continued inequality in a particular area, this study demonstrates that socio-economic and health inequality measured across numerous indicators continues to align with historic discriminatory housing boundaries.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Redlining; Environmental justice; Urban inequality\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'M.

The provision of equal opportunities is becoming increasingly difficult due to urbanization. Most studies examined the inequality in context with social indicators and few empirical studies focused on the distribution of opportunities in the form of opportunity indices. This study aims to examine the spatial distribution of public facilities in 36 districts of Punjab province, Pakistan. We develop a composite opportunity index from various social indicators retrieved from household surveys. Using global and local Moran's indices, we analyzed the social indicators along three lines, i.e., health, education, and civic facilities. We investigated inequalities in opportunities through its various factors derived from NOAA nighttime light data and other global data sets. Results reveal that the allocation of facilities is clustered in north and north-eastern regions of Punjab while southern areas are having large inequality of opportunities in accessing basic services. The inequalities are driven particularly in terms of poverty, road accessibility, and urban infrastructure depicted through nighttime data, while it is not driven by population. The evidence-based method in this research will help implicate policies through prioritizing resource allocation in terms of space and equal opportunities.\\r\\n\",b'Keywords: Urban sustainability; Social exclusion; Composite opportunity index; NOAA NTL; Spatial mapping; Geographical weighted regression\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Stuart Cameron,\\r\\n',b'Whether and where to enrol?

But there is little in the research literature about education of children who live in slums and it is doubtful whether they are covered in official statistics such as those on enrolment rates. This paper addresses this gap with information from a 2008 survey of around 1600 slum households. Most had incomes of less than US$1 per day per person, and faced problems including flooding, poor housing, and risk of eviction. A wide range of school types provided education to children from the study areas, but this varied a lot between different slums. The paper focuses on how parents and children made decisions about schooling, in a context where the options on offer are less than ideal. Overall around 70% of children were enrolled in primary school. Most were in government or NGO schools, with minorities in madrasas and private schools. Almost half of the school-going children were supplementing their classes with private tuition. Regression analysis shows that children from wealthier households and with more highly educated parents, were more likely to be in school, more likely to be in a private school rather than other types, and less likely to be in an NGO school. However, location and the range of schools on offer were also important. The paper concludes by considering how government and NGOs could improve provision to the urban poor.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Bangladesh; South Asia; Economics; Slums; Urban poverty; Private tuition; Drop-out; Non-state providers\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Tony G.

Urban air quality remains a major concern for both public health officials and the general public. In the United States, air quality public awareness campaigns are major efforts of governments at every level. Yet, our understanding of relationships between ambient air pollution exposure, public perceptions of air quality, and concerns about associated health risks is incomplete. We examined 2869 individual responses to annual air quality public awareness surveys administered between 2009 and 2012 in the Kansas City metropolitan area. Our study had three objectives: 1) examine the spatial distribution of PM2.5 and O3 exposures, pollution perceptions, and pollution health concerns; 2) explore relationships between individual- and area-level characteristics and PM2.5 and O3 exposure; 3) and examine cross-sectional associations between individual- and area-level characteristics, as well as PM2.5 and O3 exposures, and pollution perception and pollution health concerns. We found inverse spatial patterns between the distribution of O3 and PM2.5 exposure levels as well as between areas where respondents perceived air pollution as worsening and areas where residents had higher concern about the health effects of pollution exposure. We also found inverse relationships between individual- and area-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and O3 and PM2.5 exposure. Individual-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution perceptions, while both individual- and area-level characteristics were significantly related to pollution health concerns. Public awareness campaigns should be combined with education on ways the public can protect themselves and tailored explicitly for targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly, and persons with respiratory problems) and areas both socioeconomically vulnerable (e.g., higher racial segregation and poverty) and experiencing higher pollution exposure (e.g., O3 and PM2.5).\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Karen Lucas,\\r\\n',b'Making the connections between transport disadvantage and the social exclusion of low income populations in the Tshwane Region of South Africa,\\r\\n',b'Journal of Transport Geography,\\r\\n',b'Volume 19, Issue 6,\\r\\n',b'2011,\\r\\n',b'Pages 1320-1334,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0966-6923,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2011.02.007.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692311000196)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: To date, the majority of studies which consider transport from a social exclusion perspective have been conducted in the context of the developed world where both income poverty and lack of transport are relative rather absolute states. In a unique departure from these previous studies, this paper explores the relationship between transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the key difference being that income poverty is absolute and where there is much lower access to both private and public transportation generally. Thus, it seeks to explore whether the concept of social exclusion remains valid, when it is the majority of the population that is experiencing transport and income poverty compared with the minority who do so in advanced economies. The paper is based on a scoping study for the Republic of South Africa Department of Transport (RSA DOT), which primarily involved focus group discussions with a range of socially deprived urban and peri-urban population groups living in the Tshwane region of South Africa. In a second departure from previous studies which consider transport and social disadvantage in the development context, the study takes a primarily urban focus. The rationale for this is that theoretically low income urban settlements do not suffer from the lack of transport infrastructure and motorised transport services in the way that more remote rural areas do. The policy issue is therefore less a question of addressing a deficit in supply and more one of addressing particular aspects of public transit service failure, which are more readily amenable to relatively low cost, manageable, small-scale national and local policy interventions. A primary aim for the study was to reinvigorate cross-government debate of these issues in the hope of breaking South African government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-standing and persistent policy inertia in the delivery of equitable and socially sustainable urban transport systems.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Transportation policy; Poverty; Disadvantage; Social exclusion; South Africa\\r\\n',b'\\n',b'Mengyi Li, Shahir Masri, Chun-Huo Chiu, Yi Sun, Jun Wu,\\r\\n',b'Mapping wild vascular plant species diversity in urban areas in California using crowdsourcing data by regression kriging: Examining socioeconomic disparities,\\r\\n',b'Science of The Total Environment,\\r\\n',b'Volume 905,\\r\\n',b'2023,\\r\\n',b'166995,\\r\\n',b'ISSN 0048-9697,\\r\\n',b'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166995.\\r\\n',b'(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723056206)\\r\\n',b'Abstract: Biodiversity is crucial for human health, but previous methods of measuring biodiversity require intensive resources and have other limitations.

GAM OK was further applied to extrapolate species diversity metrics from saturated grid cells (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa0841) to the remaining grid cells with <80\\xc2\\xa0% sample completeness (N\\xc2\\xa0=\\xc2\\xa03914) and generate diversity maps that cover the grid. Further, generalized linear mixed models were used to examine the associations between species diversity and sociodemographic indicators at census tract level. The wild vascular plant species diversity metrics were inversely associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status (i.e., unemployment, linguistic isolation, educational attainment, and poverty rate). Minority populations (i.e., African American, Asian American, and Hispanic) and children had significantly lower diversity exposure in their neighborhoods. Crowdsourcing data offers a cost-effective solution for characterizing large-scale biodiversity in urban areas.\\r\\n',b'Keywords: Urban plant biodiversity; Vascular plant species diversity map; Socio-economic status; Citizen science\\r\\n'\n"
